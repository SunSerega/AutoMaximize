Introduction
This document describes the OpenGL graphics system: what it is, how it acts, and
what is required to implement it. We assume that the reader has at least a rudi-
mentary understanding of computer graphics. This means familiarity with the es-
sentials of computer graphics algorithms as well as familiarity with basic graphics
hardware and associated terms.
1.1 Formatting of Optional Features
Starting with version 1.2 of OpenGL, some features in the speci?cation are consid-
ered optional; an OpenGL implementation may or may not choose to provide them
(see section 3.6.2).
Portions of the speci?cation which are optional are so described where the
optional features are ?rst de?ned (see section 3.6.2). State table entries which are
optional are typeset against a gray background .
1.2 What is the OpenGL Graphics System?
OpenGL (for “Open Graphics Library”) is a software interface to graphics hard-
ware. The interface consists of a set of several hundred procedures and functions
that allow a programmer to specify the objects and operations involved in produc-
ing high-quality graphical images, speci?cally color images of three-dimensional
objects.
Most of OpenGL requires that the graphics hardware contain a framebuffer.
Many OpenGL calls pertain to drawing objects such as points, lines, polygons, and
bitmaps, but the way that some of this drawing occurs (such as when antialiasing
11.3. PROGRAMMER’SVIEWOFOPENGL 2
or texturing is enabled) relies on the existence of a framebuffer. Further, some of
OpenGL is speci?cally concerned with framebuffer manipulation.
1.3 Programmer’s View of OpenGL
To the programmer, OpenGL is a set of commands that allow the speci?cation of
geometric objects in two or three dimensions, together with commands that control
how these objects are rendered into the framebuffer. For the most part, OpenGL
provides an immediate-mode interface, meaning that specifying an object causes it
to be drawn.
A typical program that uses OpenGL begins with calls to open a window into
the framebuffer into which the program will draw. Then, calls are made to allocate
a GL context and associate it with the window. Once a GL context is allocated,
the programmer is free to issue OpenGL commands. Some calls are used to draw
simple geometric objects (i.e. points, line segments, and polygons), while others
affect the rendering of these primitives including how they are lit or colored and
how they are mapped from the user’s two- or three-dimensional model space to
the two-dimensional screen. There are also calls to effect direct control of the
framebuffer, such as reading and writing pixels.
1.4 Implementor’s View of OpenGL
To the implementor, OpenGL is a set of commands that affect the operation of
graphics hardware. If the hardware consists only of an addressable framebuffer,
then OpenGL must be implemented almost entirely on the host CPU. More typi-
cally, the graphics hardware may comprise varying degrees of graphics accelera-
tion, from a raster subsystem capable of rendering two-dimensional lines and poly-
gons to sophisticated ?oating-point processors capable of transforming and com-
puting on geometric data. The OpenGL implementor’s task is to provide the CPU
software interface while dividing the work for each OpenGL command between
the CPU and the graphics hardware. This division must be tailored to the available
graphics hardware to obtain optimum performance in carrying out OpenGL calls.
OpenGL maintains a considerable amount of state information. This state con-
trols how objects are drawn into the framebuffer. Some of this state is directly
available to the user: he or she can make calls to obtain its value. Some of it, how-
ever, is visible only by the effect it has on what is drawn. One of the main goals of
this speci?cation is to make OpenGL state information explicit, to elucidate how it
changes, and to indicate what its effects are.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20041.5. OURVIEW 3
1.5 Our View
We view OpenGL as a state machine that controls a set of speci?c drawing oper-
ations. This model should engender a speci?cation that satis?es the needs of both
programmers and implementors. It does not, however, necessarily provide a model
for implementation. An implementation must produce results conforming to those
produced by the speci?ed methods, but there may be ways to carry out a particular
computation that are more ef?cient than the one speci?ed.
1.6 Companion Documents
This speci?cation should be read together with a companion document titled The
OpenGL Shading Language. The latter document (referred to as the OpenGL Shad-
ing Language Specification hereafter) de?nes the syntax and semantics of the pro-
gramming language used to write vertex and fragment shaders (see sections 2.15
and 3.11). These sections may include references to concepts and terms (such as
shading language variable types) de?ned in the companion document.
OpenGL 2.0 implementations are guaranteed to support at least version 1.10 of
the shading language; the actual version supported may be queried as described in
section 6.1.11.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Chapter 2
OpenGL Operation
2.1 OpenGL Fundamentals
OpenGL (henceforth, the “GL”) is concerned only with rendering into a frame-
buffer (and reading values stored in that framebuffer). There is no support for
other peripherals sometimes associated with graphics hardware, such as mice and
keyboards. Programmers must rely on other mechanisms to obtain user input.
The GL draws primitives subject to a number of selectable modes. Each prim-
itive is a point, line segment, polygon, or pixel rectangle. Each mode may be
changed independently; the setting of one does not affect the settings of others
(although many modes may interact to determine what eventually ends up in the
framebuffer). Modes are set, primitives speci?ed, and other GL operations de-
scribed by sending commands in the form of function or procedure calls.
Primitives are de?ned by a group of one or more vertices. A vertex de?nes a
point, an endpoint of an edge, or a corner of a polygon where two edges meet. Data
(consisting of positional coordinates, colors, normals, and texture coordinates) are
associated with a vertex and each vertex is processed independently, in order, and
in the same way. The only exception to this rule is if the group of vertices must
be clipped so that the indicated primitive ?ts within a speci?ed region; in this
case vertex data may be modi?ed and new vertices created. The type of clipping
depends on which primitive the group of vertices represents.
Commands are always processed in the order in which they are received, al-
though there may be an indeterminate delay before the effects of a command are
realized. This means, for example, that one primitive must be drawn completely
before any subsequent one can affect the framebuffer. It also means that queries
and pixel read operations return state consistent with complete execution of all
previously invoked GL commands, except where explicitly speci?ed otherwise. In
42.1. OPENGLFUNDAMENTALS 5
general, the effects of a GL command on either GL modes or the framebuffer must
be complete before any subsequent command can have any such effects.
In the GL, data binding occurs on call. This means that data passed to a com-
mand are interpreted when that command is received. Even if the command re-
quires a pointer to data, those data are interpreted when the call is made, and any
subsequent changes to the data have no effect on the GL (unless the same pointer
is used in a subsequent command).
The GL provides direct control over the fundamental operations of 3D and 2D
graphics. This includes speci?cation of such parameters as transformation matri-
ces, lighting equation coef?cients, antialiasing methods, and pixel update opera-
tors. It does not provide a means for describing or modeling complex geometric
objects. Another way to describe this situation is to say that the GL provides mech-
anisms to describe how complex geometric objects are to be rendered rather than
mechanisms to describe the complex objects themselves.
The model for interpretation of GL commands is client-server. That is, a pro-
gram (the client) issues commands, and these commands are interpreted and pro-
cessed by the GL (the server). The server may or may not operate on the same
computer as the client. In this sense, the GL is “network-transparent.” A server
may maintain a number of GL contexts, each of which is an encapsulation of cur-
rent GL state. A client may choose to connect to any one of these contexts. Issuing
GL commands when the program is not connected to a context results in unde?ned
behavior.
The effects of GL commands on the framebuffer are ultimately controlled by
the window system that allocates framebuffer resources. It is the window sys-
tem that determines which portions of the framebuffer the GL may access at any
given time and that communicates to the GL how those portions are structured.
Therefore, there are no GL commands to con?gure the framebuffer or initialize the
GL. Similarly, display of framebuffer contents on a CRT monitor (including the
transformation of individual framebuffer values by such techniques as gamma cor-
rection) is not addressed by the GL. Framebuffer con?guration occurs outside of
the GL in conjunction with the window system; the initialization of a GL context
occurs when the window system allocates a window for GL rendering.
The GL is designed to be run on a range of graphics platforms with varying
graphics capabilities and performance. To accommodate this variety, we specify
ideal behavior instead of actual behavior for certain GL operations. In cases where
deviation from the ideal is allowed, we also specify the rules that an implemen-
tation must obey if it is to approximate the ideal behavior usefully. This allowed
variation in GL behavior implies that two distinct GL implementations may not
agree pixel for pixel when presented with the same input even when run on identi-
cal framebuffer con?gurations.

Finally, command names, constants, and types are pre?xed in the GL (by gl,
GL , andGL, respectively inC) to reduce name clashes with other packages. The
pre?xes are omitted in this document for clarity.
2.1.1 Floating-Point Computation
The GL must perform a number of ?oating-point operations during the course of
its operation. We do not specify how ?oating-point numbers are to be represented
or how operations on them are to be performed. We require simply that numbers’
?oating-point parts contain enough bits and that their exponent ?elds are large
enough so that individual results of ?oating-point operations are accurate to about
5
1 part in 10 . The maximum representable magnitude of a ?oating-point number
32
used to represent positional, normal, or texture coordinates must be at least 2 ;
10
the maximum representable magnitude for colors must be at least 2 . The max-

Most single-precision ?oating-point formats meet these requirements.
Any representable ?oating-point value is legal as input to a GL command that
requires ?oating-point data. The result of providing a value that is not a ?oating-
point number to such a command is unspeci?ed, but must not lead to GL interrup-
tion or termination. In IEEE arithmetic, for example, providing a negative zero or a
denormalized number to a GL command yields predictable results, while providing
a NaN or an in?nity yields unspeci?ed results.
Some calculations require division. In such cases (including implied divisions
required by vector normalizations), a division by zero produces an unspeci?ed re-
sult but must not lead to GL interruption or termination.
2.2 GL State
The GL maintains considerable state. This document enumerates each state vari-
able and describes how each variable can be changed. For purposes of discussion,
state variables are categorized somewhat arbitrarily by their function. Although we
describe the operations that the GL performs on the framebuffer, the framebuffer
is not a part of GL state.
We distinguish two types of state. The ?rst type of state, called GL server
state, resides in the GL server. The majority of GL state falls into this category.
The second type of state, called GL client state, resides in the GL client. Unless
otherwise speci?ed, all state referred to in this document is GL server state; GL
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.3. GLCOMMANDSYNTAX 7
client state is speci?cally identi?ed. Each instance of a GL context implies one
complete set of GL server state; each connection from a client to a server implies
a set of both GL client state and GL server state.
While an implementation of the GL may be hardware dependent, this discus-
sion is independent of the speci?c hardware on which a GL is implemented. We are
therefore concerned with the state of graphics hardware only when it corresponds
precisely to GL state.
2.3 GL Command Syntax
GL commands are functions or procedures. Various groups of commands perform
the same operation but differ in how arguments are supplied to them. To conve-
niently accommodate this variation, we adopt a notation for describing commands
and their arguments.
GL commands are formed from a name followed, depending on the particular
command, by up to 4 characters. The ?rst character indicates the number of values
of the indicated type that must be presented to the command. The second character
or character pair indicates the speci?c type of the arguments: 8-bit integer, 16-bit
integer, 32-bit integer, single-precision ?oating-point, or double-precision ?oating-
point. The ?nal character, if present, is v, indicating that the command takes a
pointer to an array (a vector) of values rather than a series of individual arguments.
Two speci?c examples come from the Vertex command:
void Vertex3f(float x,float y,float z );
and
void Vertex2sv(short v[2] );
These examples show the ANSIC declarations for these commands. In general,
1
a command declaration has the form
rtype Name{1234}{ b s i f d ub us ui}{v}
( [args ,] T arg1 ,... , T argN [, args] );
rtype is the return type of the function. The braces ({}) enclose a series of char-
acters (or character pairs) of which one is selected.  indicates no character. The
arguments enclosed in brackets ([args ,] and [, args]) may or may not be present.
1
The declarations shown in this document apply to ANSI C. Languages such as C++ and Ada
that allow passing of argument type information admit simpler declarations and fewer entry points.

Table 2.1: Correspondence of command suf?x letters to GL argument types. Refer
to table 2.2 for de?nitions of the GL types.
TheN arguments arg1 through argN have type T, which corresponds to one of the
type letters or letter pairs as indicated in table 2.1 (if there are no letters, then the
arguments’ type is given explicitly). If the ?nal character is not v, thenN is given
by the digit 1, 2, 3, or 4 (if there is no digit, then the number of arguments is ?xed).
If the ?nal character is v, then only arg1 is present and it is an array of N values
of the indicated type. Finally, we indicate anunsigned type by the shorthand of
prepending au to the beginning of the type name (so that, for instance,unsigned
char is abbreviateduchar).
For example,
void Normal3{fd}(T arg );
indicates the two declarations
void Normal3f(float arg1,float arg2,float arg3 );
void Normal3d(double arg1,double arg2,double arg3 );
while
void Normal3{fd}v(T arg );
means the two declarations
void Normal3fv(float arg[3] );
void Normal3dv(double arg[3] );
Arguments whose type is ?xed (i.e. not indicated by a suf?x on the command)
are of one of 14 types (or pointers to one of these). These types are summarized in
table 2.2.

type int is referred to as GLint outside this document, and is not necessarily
equivalent to the C type int. An implementation may use more bits than the
number indicated in the table to represent a GL type. Correct interpretation of
integer values outside the minimum range is not required, however.
ptrbits is the number of bits required to represent a pointer type; in other words,

2.4 Basic GL Operation
Figure 2.1 shows a schematic diagram of the GL. Commands enter the GL on the
left. Some commands specify geometric objects to be drawn while others control
how the objects are handled by the various stages. Most commands may be ac-
cumulated in a display list for processing by the GL at a later time. Otherwise,
commands are effectively sent through a processing pipeline.
The ?rst stage provides an ef?cient means for approximating curve and sur-
face geometry by evaluating polynomial functions of input values. The next stage
operates on geometric primitives described by vertices: points, line segments, and
polygons. In this stage vertices are transformed and lit, and primitives are clipped
to a viewing volume in preparation for the next stage, rasterization. The rasterizer
produces a series of framebuffer addresses and values using a two-dimensional de-
scription of a point, line segment, or polygon. Each fragment so produced is fed
to the next stage that performs operations on individual fragments before they ?-
nally alter the framebuffer. These operations include conditional updates into the
framebuffer based on incoming and previously stored depth values (to effect depth
buffering), blending of incoming fragment colors with stored colors, as well as
masking and other logical operations on fragment values.
Finally, there is a way to bypass the vertex processing portion of the pipeline to
send a block of fragments directly to the individual fragment operations, eventually
causing a block of pixels to be written to the framebuffer; values may also be read
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.5. GLERRORS 11
back from the framebuffer or copied from one portion of the framebuffer to another.
These transfers may include some type of decoding or encoding.
This ordering is meant only as a tool for describing the GL, not as a strict rule
of how the GL is implemented, and we present it only as a means to organize the
various operations of the GL. Objects such as curved surfaces, for instance, may
be transformed before they are converted to polygons.
2.5 GL Errors
The GL detects only a subset of those conditions that could be considered errors.
This is because in many cases error checking would adversely impact the perfor-
mance of an error-free program.
The command
enum GetError(void );
is used to obtain error information. Each detectable error is assigned a numeric
code. When an error is detected, a ?ag is set and the code is recorded. Further
errors, if they occur, do not affect this recorded code. When GetError is called,
the code is returned and the ?ag is cleared, so that a further error will again record
its code. If a call to GetError returnsNO ERROR, then there has been no detectable
error since the last call to GetError (or since the GL was initialized).
To allow for distributed implementations, there may be several ?ag-code pairs.
In this case, after a call to GetError returns a value other than NO ERROR each
subsequent call returns the non-zero code of a distinct ?ag-code pair (in unspeci?ed
order), until all non-NO ERROR codes have been returned. When there are no more
non-NO ERROR error codes, all ?ags are reset. This scheme requires some positive
number of pairs of a ?ag bit and an integer. The initial state of all ?ags is cleared
and the initial value of all codes isNO ERROR.
Table 2.3 summarizes GL errors. Currently, when an error ?ag is set, results of
GL operation are unde?ned only if OUT OF MEMORY has occurred. In other cases,
the command generating the error is ignored so that it has no effect on GL state or
framebuffer contents. If the generating command returns a value, it returns zero. If
the generating command modi?es values through a pointer argument, no change is
made to these values. These error semantics apply only to GL errors, not to system
errors such as memory access errors. This behavior is the current behavior; the
action of the GL in the presence of errors is subject to change.
Several error generation conditions are implicit in the description of every GL
command:

Table 2.3: Summary of GL errors
• If a command that requires an enumerated value is passed a symbolic con-
stant that is not one of those speci?ed as allowable for that command, the
error INVALID ENUM error is generated. This is the case even if the argu-
ment is a pointer to a symbolic constant, if value pointer to is not allowable
for the given command.
• If a negative number is provided where an argument of typesizei is spec-
i?ed, the errorINVALID VALUE is generated.
• If memory is exhausted as a side effect of the execution of a command, the
errorOUT OF MEMORY may be generated.
Otherwise, errors are generated only for conditions that are explicitly described in
this speci?cation.
2.6 Begin/End Paradigm
In the GL, most geometric objects are drawn by enclosing a series of coordinate
sets that specify vertices and optionally normals, texture coordinates, and colors
between Begin/End pairs. There are ten geometric objects that are drawn this
way: points, line segments, line segment loops, separated line segments, polygons,
triangle strips, triangle fans, separated triangles, quadrilateral strips, and separated
quadrilaterals.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.6. BEGIN/ENDPARADIGM 13
Each vertex is speci?ed with two, three, or four coordinates. In addition, a
current normal, multiple current texture coordinate sets, multiple current generic
vertex attributes, current color, current secondary color, and current fog coor-
dinate may be used in processing each vertex. Normals are used by the GL in
lighting calculations; the current normal is a three-dimensional vector that may be
set by sending three coordinates that specify it. Texture coordinates determine how
a texture image is mapped onto a primitive. Multiple sets of texture coordinates
may be used to specify how multiple texture images are mapped onto a primitive.
The number of texture units supported is implementation dependent but must be
at least two. The number of texture units supported can be queried with the state
MAX TEXTURE UNITS. Generic vertex attributes can be accessed from within ver-
tex shaders (section 2.15) and used to compute values for consumption by later
processing stages.
Primary and secondary colors are associated with each vertex (see section 3.9).
These associated colors are either based on the current color and current secondary
color or produced by lighting, depending on whether or not lighting is enabled.
Texture and fog coordinates are similarly associated with each vertex. Multiple
sets of texture coordinates may be associated with a vertex. Figure 2.2 summarizes
the association of auxiliary data with a transformed vertex to produce a processed
vertex.
The current values are part of GL state. Vertices and normals are transformed,
colors may be affected or replaced by lighting, and texture coordinates are trans-
formed and possibly affected by a texture coordinate generation function. The
processing indicated for each current value is applied for each vertex that is sent to
the GL.
The methods by which vertices, normals, texture coordinates, , fog coordinate,
generic attributes, and colors are sent to the GL, as well as how normals are trans-
formed and how vertices are mapped to the two-dimensional screen, are discussed
later.
Before colors have been assigned to a vertex, the state required by a vertex
is the vertex’s coordinates, the current normal, the current edge ?ag (see sec-
tion 2.6.2), the current material properties (see section 2.14.2), the current fog
coordinate, the multiple generic vertex attribute sets, and the multiple current tex-
ture coordinate sets. Because color assignment is done vertex-by-vertex, a pro-
cessed vertex comprises the vertex’s coordinates, its edge ?ag, its fog coordinate,
its assigned colors, and its multiple texture coordinate sets.
Figure 2.3 shows the sequence of operations that builds a primitive (point, line
segment, or polygon) from a sequence of vertices. After a primitive is formed, it
is clipped to a viewing volume. This may alter the primitive by altering vertex
coordinates, texture coordinates, and colors. In the case of line and polygon prim-

itives, clipping may insert new vertices into the primitive. The vertices de?ning a
primitive to be rasterized have texture coordinates and colors associated with them.
2.6.1 Begin and End
Vertices making up one of the supported geometric object types are speci?ed by
enclosing commands de?ning those vertices between the two commands
void Begin(enum mode );
void End(void );
There is no limit on the number of vertices that may be speci?ed between a Begin
and an End.
Points. A series of individual points may be speci?ed by calling Begin with an
argument value ofPOINTS. No special state need be kept between Begin and End
in this case, since each point is independent of previous and following points.
Line Strips. A series of one or more connected line segments is speci?ed by
enclosing a series of two or more endpoints within a Begin/End pair when Begin is
called with LINE STRIP. In this case, the ?rst vertex speci?es the ?rst segment’s
start point while the second vertex speci?es the ?rst segment’s endpoint and the
second segment’s start point. In general, the ith vertex (for i > 1) speci?es the
beginning of the ith segment and the end of the i? 1st. The last vertex speci?es
the end of the last segment. If only one vertex is speci?ed between the Begin/End
pair, then no primitive is generated.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.6. BEGIN/ENDPARADIGM 16
The required state consists of the processed vertex produced from the last ver-
tex that was sent (so that a line segment can be generated from it to the current
vertex), and a boolean ?ag indicating if the current vertex is the ?rst vertex.
Line Loops. Line loops, speci?ed with the LINE LOOP argument value to
Begin, are the same as line strips except that a ?nal segment is added from the ?nal
speci?ed vertex to the ?rst vertex. The additional state consists of the processed
?rst vertex.
Separate Lines. Individual line segments, each speci?ed by a pair of vertices,
are generated by surrounding vertex pairs with Begin and End when the value
of the argument to Begin is LINES. In this case, the ?rst two vertices between a
Begin and End pair de?ne the ?rst segment, with subsequent pairs of vertices each
de?ning one more segment. If the number of speci?ed vertices is odd, then the last
one is ignored. The state required is the same as for lines but it is used differently: a
vertex holding the ?rst vertex of the current segment, and a boolean ?ag indicating
whether the current vertex is odd or even (a segment start or end).
Polygons. A polygon is described by specifying its boundary as a series of
line segments. When Begin is called with POLYGON, the bounding line segments
are speci?ed in the same way as line loops. Depending on the current state of the
GL, a polygon may be rendered in one of several ways such as outlining its border
or ?lling its interior. A polygon described with fewer than three vertices does not
generate a primitive.
Only convex polygons are guaranteed to be drawn correctly by the GL. If a
speci?ed polygon is nonconvex when projected onto the window, then the rendered
polygon need only lie within the convex hull of the projected vertices de?ning its
boundary.
The state required to support polygons consists of at least two processed ver-
tices (more than two are never required, although an implementation may use
more); this is because a convex polygon can be rasterized as its vertices arrive,
before all of them have been speci?ed. The order of the vertices is signi?cant in
lighting and polygon rasterization (see sections 2.14.1 and 3.5.1).
Triangle strips. A triangle strip is a series of triangles connected along shared
edges. A triangle strip is speci?ed by giving a series of de?ning vertices between
a Begin/End pair when Begin is called with TRIANGLE STRIP. In this case, the
?rst three vertices de?ne the ?rst triangle (and their order is signi?cant, just as for
polygons). Each subsequent vertex de?nes a new triangle using that point along
with two vertices from the previous triangle. A Begin/End pair enclosing fewer
than three vertices, whenTRIANGLE STRIP has been supplied to Begin, produces
no primitive. See ?gure 2.4.
The state required to support triangle strips consists of a ?ag indicating if the
?rst triangle has been completed, two stored processed vertices, (called vertex A

and vertex B), and a one bit pointer indicating which stored vertex will be replaced
with the next vertex. After a Begin(TRIANGLE STRIP), the pointer is initialized
to point to vertex A. Each vertex sent between a Begin/End pair toggles the pointer.
Therefore, the ?rst vertex is stored as vertex A, the second stored as vertex B, the
third stored as vertex A, and so on. Any vertex after the second one sent forms a
triangle from vertex A, vertex B, and the current vertex (in that order).
Triangle fans. A triangle fan is the same as a triangle strip with one exception:
each vertex after the ?rst always replaces vertex B of the two stored vertices. The
vertices of a triangle fan are enclosed between Begin and End when the value of
the argument to Begin isTRIANGLE FAN.
Separate Triangles. Separate triangles are speci?ed by placing vertices be-
tween Begin and End when the value of the argument to Begin isTRIANGLES. In
this case, The 3i + 1st, 3i + 2nd, and 3i + 3rd vertices (in that order) determine
a triangle for each i = 0,1,...,n? 1, where there are 3n +k vertices between
the Begin and End. k is either 0, 1, or 2; if k is not zero, the ?nal k vertices are
ignored. For each triangle, vertex A is vertex 3i and vertex B is vertex 3i + 1.
Otherwise, separate triangles are the same as a triangle strip.
The rules given for polygons also apply to each triangle generated from a tri-
angle strip, triangle fan or from separate triangles.
Quadrilateral (quad) strips. Quad strips generate a series of edge-sharing
quadrilaterals from vertices appearing between Begin and End, when Begin is

called with QUAD STRIP. If the m vertices between the Begin and End are
v ,...,v , where v is the jth speci?ed vertex, then quad i has vertices (in or-
1 m j
der)v ,v ,v , andv withi = 0,...,bm/2c. The state required is thus

three processed vertices, to store the last two vertices of the previous quad along
with the third vertex (the ?rst new vertex) of the current quad, a ?ag to indicate
when the ?rst quad has been completed, and a one-bit counter to count members
of a vertex pair. See ?gure 2.5.
A quad strip with fewer than four vertices generates no primitive. If the number
of vertices speci?ed for a quadrilateral strip between Begin and End is odd, the
?nal vertex is ignored.
Separate Quadrilaterals Separate quads are just like quad strips except that
each group of four vertices, the 4j + 1st, the 4j + 2nd, the 4j + 3rd, and the
4j + 4th, generate a single quad, for j = 0,1,...,n? 1. The total number of
vertices between Begin and End is 4n+k, where 0? k? 3; ifk is not zero, the
?nal k vertices are ignored. Separate quads are generated by calling Begin with
the argument valueQUADS.
The rules given for polygons also apply to each quad generated in a quad strip
or from separate quads.
The state required for Begin and End consists of an eleven-valued integer indi-
cating either one of the ten possible Begin/End modes, or that no Begin/End mode
is being processed.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.6. BEGIN/ENDPARADIGM 19
2.6.2 Polygon Edges
Each edge of each primitive generated from a polygon, triangle strip, triangle fan,
separate triangle set, quadrilateral strip, or separate quadrilateral set, is ?agged as
either boundary or non-boundary. These classi?cations are used during polygon
rasterization; some modes affect the interpretation of polygon boundary edges (see
section 3.5.4). By default, all edges are boundary edges, but the ?agging of poly-
gons, separate triangles, or separate quadrilaterals may be altered by calling
void EdgeFlag(boolean ?ag );
void EdgeFlagv(boolean *?ag );
to change the value of a ?ag bit. If ?ag is zero, then the ?ag bit is set toFALSE; if
?ag is non-zero, then the ?ag bit is set toTRUE.
When Begin is supplied with one of the argument values POLYGON,
TRIANGLES, or QUADS, each vertex speci?ed within a Begin and End pair be-
gins an edge. If the edge ?ag bit isTRUE, then each speci?ed vertex begins an edge
that is ?agged as boundary. If the bit isFALSE, then induced edges are ?agged as
non-boundary.
The state required for edge ?agging consists of one current ?ag bit. Initially, the
bit isTRUE. In addition, each processed vertex of an assembled polygonal primitive
must be augmented with a bit indicating whether or not the edge beginning on that
vertex is boundary or non-boundary.
2.6.3 GL Commands within Begin/End
The only GL commands that are allowed within any Begin/End pairs are the com-
mands for specifying vertex coordinates, vertex colors, normal coordinates, texture
coordinates, generic vertex attributes, and fog coordinates (Vertex, Color, Sec-
ondaryColor, Index, Normal, TexCoord and MultiTexCoord, VertexAttrib,
FogCoord), the ArrayElement command (see section 2.8), the EvalCoord and
EvalPoint commands (see section 5.1), commands for specifying lighting mate-
rial parameters (Material commands; see section 2.14.2), display list invocation
commands (CallList and CallLists; see section 5.4), and the EdgeFlag command.
Executing any other GL command between the execution of Begin and the corre-
sponding execution of End results in the error INVALID OPERATION. Executing
Begin after Begin has already been executed but before an End is executed gen-
erates the INVALID OPERATION error, as does executing End without a previous
corresponding Begin.
Execution of the commands EnableClientState, DisableClientState, Push-
ClientAttrib, PopClientAttrib, ColorPointer, FogCoordPointer, EdgeFlag-
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.7. VERTEXSPECIFICATION 20
Pointer, IndexPointer, NormalPointer, TexCoordPointer, SecondaryColor-
Pointer, VertexPointer, VertexAttribPointer, ClientActiveTexture, Inter-
leavedArrays, and PixelStore is not allowed within any Begin/End pair, but an
error may or may not be generated if such execution occurs. If an error is not gen-
erated, GL operation is unde?ned. (These commands are described in sections 2.8,
3.6.1, and chapter 6.)
2.7 Vertex Specification
Vertices are speci?ed by giving their coordinates in two, three, or four dimensions.
This is done using one of several versions of the Vertex command:
void Vertex{234}{sifd}(T coords );
void Vertex{234}{sifd}v(T coords );
A call to any Vertex command speci?es four coordinates: x, y, z, and w. The
x coordinate is the ?rst coordinate, y is second, z is third, and w is fourth. A
call to Vertex2 sets the x and y coordinates; the z coordinate is implicitly set to
zero and thew coordinate to one. Vertex3 setsx,y, andz to the provided values
and w to one. Vertex4 sets all four coordinates, allowing the speci?cation of an
arbitrary point in projective three-space. Invoking a Vertex command outside of a
Begin/End pair results in unde?ned behavior.
Current values are used in associating auxiliary data with a vertex as described
in section 2.6. A current value may be changed at any time by issuing an appropri-
ate command. The commands
void TexCoord{1234}{sifd}(T coords );
void TexCoord{1234}{sifd}v(T coords );
specify the current homogeneous texture coordinates, named s, t, r, and q. The
TexCoord1 family of commands set thes coordinate to the provided single argu-
ment while settingt andr to 0 andq to 1. Similarly, TexCoord2 setss andt to the
speci?ed values,r to 0 andq to 1; TexCoord3 setss,t, andr, withq set to 1, and
TexCoord4 sets all four texture coordinates.
Implementations must support at least two sets of texture coordinates. The
commands
void MultiTexCoord{1234}{sifd}(enum texture,T coords)
void MultiTexCoord{1234}{sifd}v(enum texture,T
coords)
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.7. VERTEXSPECIFICATION 21
take the coordinate set to be modi?ed as the texture parameter. texture is a symbolic
constant of the form TEXTUREi, indicating that texture coordinate set i is to be
modi?ed. The constants obey TEXTUREi = TEXTURE0+i (i is in the range 0 to
k? 1, wherek is the implementation-dependent number of texture coordinate sets
de?ned byMAX TEXTURE COORDS).
The TexCoord commands are exactly equivalent to the corresponding Multi-
TexCoord commands with texture set toTEXTURE0.
Gets of CURRENT TEXTURE COORDS return the texture coordinate set de?ned
by the value ofACTIVE TEXTURE.
Specifying an invalid texture coordinate set for the texture argument of Multi-
TexCoord results in unde?ned behavior.
The current normal is set using
void Normal3{bsifd}(T coords );
void Normal3{bsifd}v(T coords );
Byte, short, or integer values passed to Normal are converted to ?oating-point
values as indicated for the corresponding (signed) type in table 2.9.
The current fog coordinate is set using
void FogCoord{fd}(T coord );
void FogCoord{fd}v(T coord );
There are several ways to set the current color and secondary color. The GL
stores a current single-valued color index, as well as a current four-valued RGBA
color and secondary color. Either the index or the color and secondary color are
signi?cant depending as the GL is in color index mode or RGBA mode. The mode
selection is made when the GL is initialized.
The commands to set RGBA colors are
void Color{34}{bsifd ubusui}(T components );
void Color{34}{bsifd ubusui}v(T components );
void SecondaryColor3{bsifd ubusui}(T components );
void SecondaryColor3{bsifd ubusui}v(T components );
The Color command has two major variants: Color3 and Color4. The four value
versions set all four values. The three value versions set R, G, and B to the provided
values; A is set to 1.0. (The conversion of integer color components (R, G, B, and
A) to ?oating-point values is discussed in section 2.14.)
The secondary color has only the three value versions. Secondary A is always
set to 1.0.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.7. VERTEXSPECIFICATION 22
Versions of the Color and SecondaryColor commands that take ?oating-point
values accept values nominally between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 corresponds to the min-
imum while 1.0 corresponds to the maximum (machine dependent) value that a
component may take on in the framebuffer (see section 2.14 on colors and color-
ing). Values outside[0,1] are not clamped.
The command
void Index{sifd ub}(T index );
void Index{sifd ub}v(T index );
updates the current (single-valued) color index. It takes one argument, the value
to which the current color index should be set. Values outside the (machine-
dependent) representable range of color indices are not clamped.
Vertex shaders (see section 2.15) can be written to access an array of 4-
component generic vertex attributes in addition to the conventional attributes spec-
i?ed previously. The ?rst slot of this array is numbered 0, and the size of the array
is speci?ed by the implementation-dependent constantMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
The commands
void VertexAttrib{1234}{sfd}(uint index,T values );
void VertexAttrib{123}{sfd}v(uint index,T values );
void VertexAttrib4{bsifd ubusui}v(uint index,T values );
can be used to load the given value(s) into the generic attribute at slot index, whose
components are named x, y, z, and w. The VertexAttrib1* family of commands
sets the x coordinate to the provided single argument while setting y and z to 0 and
w to 1. Similarly, VertexAttrib2* commands set x and y to the speci?ed values,
z to 0 and w to 1; VertexAttrib3* commands set x, y, and z, with w set to 1, and
VertexAttrib4* commands set all four coordinates. The errorINVALID VALUE is
generated if index is greater than or equal toMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
The commands
void VertexAttrib4Nub(uint index,T values );
void VertexAttrib4N{bsi ubusui}v(uint index,T values );
also specify vertex attributes with ?xed-point coordinates that are scaled to a nor-
malized range, according to table 2.9.
The VertexAttrib* entry points de?ned earlier can also be used to load at-
tributes declared as a 2? 2, 3? 3 or 4? 4 matrix in a vertex shader. Each
column of a matrix takes up one generic 4-component attribute slot out of the
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 23
MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS available slots. Matrices are loaded into these slots in
column major order. Matrix columns need to be loaded in increasing slot numbers.
Setting generic vertex attribute zero speci?es a vertex; the four vertex coordi-
nates are taken from the values of attribute zero. A Vertex2, Vertex3, or Vertex4
command is completely equivalent to the corresponding VertexAttrib* command
with an index of zero. Setting any other generic vertex attribute updates the current
values of the attribute. There are no current values for vertex attribute zero.
There is no aliasing among generic attributes and conventional attributes. In
other words, an application can set all MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS generic attributes
and all conventional attributes without fear of one particular attribute overwriting
the value of another attribute.
The state required to support vertex speci?cation consists of four ?oating-
point numbers per texture coordinate set to store the current texture coordinatess,
t,r, andq, three ?oating-point numbers to store the three coordinates of the current
normal, one ?oating-point number to store the current fog coordinate, four ?oating-
point values to store the current RGBA color, four ?oating-point values to store the
current RGBA secondary color, one ?oating-point value to store the current color
index, and MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS? 1 four-component ?oating-point vectors to
store generic vertex attributes.
There is no notion of a current vertex, so no state is devoted to vertex coordi-
nates or generic attribute zero. The initial texture coordinates are (s,t,r,q) =
(0,0,0,1) for each texture coordinate set. The initial current normal has coor-
dinates (0,0,1). The initial fog coordinate is zero. The initial RGBA color is
(R,G,B,A) = (1,1,1,1) and the initial RGBA secondary color is (0,0,0,1).
The initial color index is 1. The initial values for all generic vertex attributes are
(0,0,0,1).
2.8 Vertex Arrays
The vertex speci?cation commands described in section 2.7 accept data in almost
any format, but their use requires many command executions to specify even sim-
ple geometry. Vertex data may also be placed into arrays that are stored in the
client’s address space. Blocks of data in these arrays may then be used to spec-
ify multiple geometric primitives through the execution of a single GL command.
The client may specify up to seven plus the values of MAX TEXTURE COORDS
andMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS arrays: one each to store vertex coordinates, normals,
colors, secondary colors, color indices, edge ?ags, fog coordinates, two or more
texture coordinate sets, and one or more generic vertex attributes. The commands
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 24
void VertexPointer(int size,enum type,sizei stride,
void *pointer );
void NormalPointer(enum type,sizei stride,
void *pointer );
void ColorPointer(int size,enum type,sizei stride,
void *pointer );
void SecondaryColorPointer(int size,enum type,
sizei stride,void *pointer );
void IndexPointer(enum type,sizei stride,void *pointer );
void EdgeFlagPointer(sizei stride,void *pointer );
void FogCoordPointer(enum type,sizei stride,
void *pointer );
void TexCoordPointer(int size,enum type,sizei stride,
void *pointer );
void VertexAttribPointer(uint index,int size,enum type,
boolean normalized,sizei stride,const
void *pointer );
describe the locations and organizations of these arrays. For each command,
type speci?es the data type of the values stored in the array. Because edge ?ags
are always type boolean, EdgeFlagPointer has no type argument. size, when
present, indicates the number of values per vertex that are stored in the array.
Because normals are always speci?ed with three values, NormalPointer has no
size argument. Likewise, because color indices and edge ?ags are always spec-
i?ed with a single value, IndexPointer and EdgeFlagPointer also have no size
argument. Table 2.4 indicates the allowable values for size and type (when
present). For type the values BYTE, SHORT, INT, FLOAT, and DOUBLE indicate
types byte, short, int, float, and double, respectively; and the values
UNSIGNED BYTE, UNSIGNED SHORT, and UNSIGNED INT indicate typesubyte,
ushort, anduint, respectively. The error INVALID VALUE is generated if size
is speci?ed with a value other than that indicated in the table.
The index parameter in the VertexAttribPointer command identi?es the
generic vertex attribute array being described. The error INVALID VALUE is gener-
ated if index is greater than or equal toMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS. The normalized pa-
rameter in the VertexAttribPointer command identi?es whether ?xed-point types

Table 2.4: Vertex array sizes (values per vertex) and data types. The ”normalized”
column indicates whether ?xed-point types are accepted directly or normalized
to [0,1] (for unsigned types) or [? 1,1] (for signed types). For generic vertex at-
tributes, ?xed-point data are normalized if and only if the VertexAttribPointer
normalized ?ag is set.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 26
should be normalized when converted to ?oating-point. If normalized is TRUE,
?xed-point data are converted as speci?ed in table 2.9; otherwise, the ?xed-point
values are converted directly.
The one, two, three, or four values in an array that correspond to a single vertex
comprise an array element. The values within each array element are stored se-
quentially in memory. If stride is speci?ed as zero, then array elements are stored
sequentially as well. The error INVALID VALUE is generated if stride is negative.
Otherwise pointers to the ith and (i + 1)st elements of an array differ by stride
basic machine units (typically unsigned bytes), the pointer to the(i+1)st element
being greater. For each command, pointer speci?es the location in memory of the
?rst value of the ?rst element of the array being speci?ed.
An individual array is enabled or disabled by calling one of
void EnableClientState(enum array );
void DisableClientState(enum array );
with array set to VERTEX ARRAY, NORMAL ARRAY, COLOR ARRAY,
SECONDARY COLOR ARRAY, INDEX ARRAY, EDGE FLAG ARRAY,
FOG COORD ARRAY, or TEXTURE COORD ARRAY, for the vertex, normal, color,
secondary color, color index, edge ?ag, fog coordinate, or texture coordinate array,
respectively.
An individual generic vertex attribute array is enabled or disabled by calling
one of
void EnableVertexAttribArray(uint index );
void DisableVertexAttribArray(uint index );
where index identi?es the generic vertex attribute array to enable or disable.
The error INVALID VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to
MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
The command
void ClientActiveTexture(enum texture );
is used to select the vertex array client state parameters to be modi?ed by
the TexCoordPointer command and the array affected by EnableClientState and
DisableClientState with parameter TEXTURE COORD ARRAY. This command sets
the client state variable CLIENT ACTIVE TEXTURE. Each texture coordinate set
has a client state vector which is selected when this command is invoked. This
state vector includes the vertex array state. This call also selects the texture
coordinate set state used for queries of client state.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 27
Specifying an invalid texture generates the errorINVALID ENUM. Valid values
of texture are the same as for the MultiTexCoord commands described in sec-
tion 2.7.
The command
void ArrayElement(int i );
transfers the ith element of every enabled array to the GL. The effect of
ArrayElement(i) is the same as the effect of the command sequence
if (normal array enabled)
Normal3[type]v(normal array elementi);

for (j = 1; j < genericAttributes; j++) {

}
if (generic attribute array 0 enabled) {
if (generic vertex attribute 0 array normalization ?ag is set, and
type is notFLOAT orDOUBLE)
VertexAttrib[size]N[type]v(0, generic vertex attribute 0 array elementi);
else
VertexAttrib[size][type]v(0, generic vertex attribute 0 array elementi);
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 28
} else if (vertex array enabled) {
Vertex[size][type]v(vertex array elementi);
}
where textureUnits and genericAttributes give the number of texture coordinate
sets and generic vertex attributes supported by the implementation, respectively.
”[size]” and ”[type]” correspond to the size and type of the corresponding array.
For generic vertex attributes, it is assumed that a complete set of vertex attribute
commands exists, even though not all such functions are provided by the GL.
Changes made to array data between the execution of Begin and the corre-
sponding execution of End may affect calls to ArrayElement that are made within
the same Begin/End period in non-sequential ways. That is, a call to ArrayEle-
ment that precedes a change to array data may access the changed data, and a call
that follows a change to array data may access original data.
Specifying i < 0 results in unde?ned behavior. Generating the error
INVALID VALUE is recommended in this case.
The command
void DrawArrays(enum mode,int ?rst,sizei count );
constructs a sequence of geometric primitives using elements first through
first + count? 1 of each enabled array. mode speci?es what kind of primi-
tives are constructed; it accepts the same token values as the mode parameter of
the Begin command. The effect of
DrawArrays(mode,first,count);
is the same as the effect of the command sequence
if (mode orcount is invalid)

else {
Begin(mode);
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)

}
with one exception: the current normal coordinates, color, secondary color, color
index, edge ?ag, fog coordinate, texture coordinates, and generic attributes are
each indeterminate after execution of DrawArrays, if the corresponding array is
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 29
enabled. Current values corresponding to disabled arrays are not modi?ed by the
execution of DrawArrays.
Specifying first < 0 results in unde?ned behavior. Generating the error
INVALID VALUE is recommended in this case.
The command
void MultiDrawArrays(enum mode,int *?rst,
sizei *count,sizei primcount );
behaves identically to DrawArrays except that primcount separate ranges of
elements are speci?ed instead. It has the same effect as:
for (i = 0; i < primcount; i++) {
if (count[i] > 0)
DrawArrays(mode, first[i], count[i]);
}
The command
void DrawElements(enum mode,sizei count,enum type,
void *indices );
constructs a sequence of geometric primitives using the count elements
whose indices are stored in indices. type must be one of UNSIGNED BYTE,
UNSIGNED SHORT, orUNSIGNED INT, indicating that the values in indices are in-
dices of GL type ubyte, ushort, or uint respectively. mode speci?es what
kind of primitives are constructed; it accepts the same token values as the mode
parameter of the Begin command. The effect of
DrawElements(mode,count,type,indices);
is the same as the effect of the command sequence
if (mode,count, ortype is invalid)

Begin(mode);

with one exception: the current normal coordinates, color, secondary color, color
index, edge ?ag, fog coordinate, texture coordinates, and generic attributes are each
indeterminate after the execution of DrawElements, if the corresponding array is
enabled. Current values corresponding to disabled arrays are not modi?ed by the
execution of DrawElements.
The command
void MultiDrawElements(enum mode,sizei *count,
enum type,void **indices,sizei primcount );
behaves identically to DrawElements except that primcount separate lists of
elements are speci?ed instead. It has the same effect as:
for (i = 0; i < primcount; i++) {
if (count[i]) > 0)
DrawElements(mode, count[i], type, indices[i]);
}
The command
void DrawRangeElements(enum mode,uint start,
uint end,sizei count,enum type,void *indices );
is a restricted form of DrawElements. mode, count, type, and indices match the
corresponding arguments to DrawElements, with the additional constraint that all
values in the array indices must lie between start and end inclusive.
Implementations denote recommended maximum amounts of vertex and index
data, which may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constants
MAX ELEMENTS VERTICES and MAX ELEMENTS INDICES. Ifend? start+1 is
greater than the value of MAX ELEMENTS VERTICES, or if count is greater than
the value of MAX ELEMENTS INDICES, then the call may operate at reduced per-
formance. There is no requirement that all vertices in the range [start,end] be
referenced. However, the implementation may partially process unused vertices,
reducing performance from what could be achieved with an optimal index set.
The error INVALID VALUE is generated ifend < start. Invalid mode, count,
or type parameters generate the same errors as would the corresponding call to
DrawElements. It is an error for indices to lie outside the range [start,end], but
implementations may not check for this. Such indices will cause implementation-
dependent behavior.
The command
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.8. VERTEXARRAYS 31
void InterleavedArrays(enum format,sizei stride,

ef?ciently initializes the six arrays and their enables to one of 14 con-

If the number of supported texture units (the value ofMAX TEXTURE COORDS)
is m and the number of supported generic vertex attributes (the value of
MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS) is n, then the client state required to implement vertex
arrays consists of an integer for the client active texture unit selector, 7+m+n
boolean values, 7 + m + n memory pointers, 7 + m + n integer stride values,
7+m+n symbolic constants representing array types,3+m+n integers repre-
senting values per element, andn boolean values indicating normalization. In the
initial state, the client active texture unit selector isTEXTURE0, the boolean values
are each false, the memory pointers are each NULL, the strides are each zero, the
array types are each FLOAT, and the integers representing values per element are
each four.
2.9 Buffer Objects
The vertex data arrays described in section 2.8 are stored in client memory. It is
sometimes desirable to store frequently used client data, such as vertex array data,
in high-performance server memory. GL buffer objects provide a mechanism that
clients can use to allocate, initialize, and render from such memory.
The name space for buffer objects is the unsigned integers, with zero re-
served for the GL. A buffer object is created by binding an unused name to
ARRAY BUFFER. The binding is effected by calling
void BindBuffer(enum target,uint buffer );
with target set toARRAY BUFFER and buffer set to the unused name. The resulting
buffer object is a new state vector, initialized with a zero-sized memory buffer, and
comprising the state values listed in table 2.6.
BindBuffer may also be used to bind an existing buffer object. If the bind is
successful no change is made to the state of the newly bound buffer object, and any
previous binding to target is broken.
While a buffer object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is bound
affect the bound buffer object, and queries of the target to which a buffer object is
bound return state from the bound object.
In the initial state the reserved name zero is bound to ARRAY BUFFER. There
is no buffer object corresponding to the name zero, so client attempts to modify

or query buffer object state for the targetARRAY BUFFER while zero is bound will
generate GL errors.
Buffer objects are deleted by calling
void DeleteBuffers(sizei n,const uint *buffers );
buffers contains n names of buffer objects to be deleted. After a buffer object is
deleted it has no contents, and its name is again unused. Unused names in buffers
are silently ignored, as is the value zero.
The command
void GenBuffers(sizei n,uint *buffers );
returns n previously unused buffer object names in buffers. These names are
marked as used, for the purposes of GenBuffers only, but they acquire buffer state
only when they are ?rst bound, just as if they were unused.
While a buffer object is bound, any GL operations on that object affect any
other bindings of that object. If a buffer object is deleted while it is bound, all
bindings to that object in the current context (i.e. in the thread that called Delete-
Buffers) are reset to zero. Bindings to that buffer in other contexts and other
threads are not affected, but attempting to use a deleted buffer in another thread
produces unde?ned results, including but not limited to possible GL errors and
rendering corruption. Using a deleted buffer in another context or thread may not,
however, result in program termination.
The data store of a buffer object is created and initialized by calling
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.9. BUFFEROBJECTS 35
void BufferData(enum target,sizeiptr size,const
void *data,enum usage );
with target set to ARRAY BUFFER, size set to the size of the data store in basic
machine units, and data pointing to the source data in client memory. If data is
non-null, then the source data is copied to the buffer object’s data store. If data is
null, then the contents of the buffer object’s data store are unde?ned.
usage is speci?ed as one of nine enumerated values, indicating the expected
application usage pattern of the data store. The values are:
STREAM DRAW The data store contents will be speci?ed once by the application,
and used at most a few times as the source of a GL drawing command.
STREAM READ The data store contents will be speci?ed once by reading data from
the GL, and queried at most a few times by the application.
STREAM COPY The data store contents will be speci?ed once by reading data from
the GL, and used at most a few times as the source of a GL drawing com-
mand.
STATIC DRAW The data store contents will be speci?ed once by the application,
and used many times as the source for GL drawing commands.
STATIC READ The data store contents will be speci?ed once by reading data from
the GL, and queried many times by the application.
STATIC COPY The data store contents will be speci?ed once by reading data from
the GL, and used many times as the source for GL drawing commands.
DYNAMIC DRAW The data store contents will be respeci?ed repeatedly by the ap-
plication, and used many times as the source for GL drawing commands.
DYNAMIC READ The data store contents will be respeci?ed repeatedly by reading
data from the GL, and queried many times by the application.
DYNAMIC COPY The data store contents will be respeci?ed repeatedly by reading
data from the GL, and used many times as the source for GL drawing com-
mands.
usage is provided as a performance hint only. The speci?ed usage value does
not constrain the actual usage pattern of the data store.
BufferData deletes any existing data store, and sets the values of the buffer
object’s state variables as shown in table 2.7.

Clients must align data elements consistent with the requirements of the client
platform, with an additional base-level requirement that an offset within a buffer to
a datum comprisingN basic machine units be a multiple ofN.
If the GL is unable to create a data store of the requested size, the error
OUT OF MEMORY is generated.
To modify some or all of the data contained in a buffer object’s data store, the
client may use the command
void BufferSubData(enum target,intptr offset,
sizeiptr size,const void *data );
with target set to ARRAY BUFFER. offset and size indicate the range of data in the
buffer object that is to be replaced, in terms of basic machine units. data speci?es a
region of client memory size basic machine units in length, containing the data that
replace the speci?ed buffer range. AnINVALID VALUE error is generated if offset
or size is less than zero, or if offset+ size is greater than the value ofBUFFER SIZE.
The entire data store of a buffer object can be mapped into the client’s address
space by calling
void *MapBuffer(enum target,enum access );
with target set to ARRAY BUFFER. If the GL is able to map the buffer object’s
data store into the client’s address space, MapBuffer returns the pointer value
to the data store. If the buffer data store is already in the mapped state, Map-
Buffer returnsNULL, and anINVALID OPERATION error is generated. Otherwise
MapBuffer returns NULL, and the error OUT OF MEMORY is generated. access is
speci?ed as one of READ ONLY, WRITE ONLY, or READ WRITE, indicating the op-
erations that the client may perform on the data store through the pointer while the

Table 2.8: Buffer object state set by MapBuffer.
Non-NULL pointers returned by MapBuffer may be used by the client to mod-
ify and query buffer object data, consistent with the access rules of the mapping,
while the mapping remains valid. No GL error is generated if the pointer is
used to attempt to modify a READ ONLY data store, or to attempt to read from a
WRITE ONLY data store, but operation may be slow and system errors (possibly in-
cluding program termination) may result. Pointer values returned by MapBuffer
may not be passed as parameter values to GL commands. For example, they may
not be used to specify array pointers, or to specify or query pixel or texture image
data; such actions produce unde?ned results, although implementations may not
check for such behavior for performance reasons.
Calling BufferSubData to modify the data store of a mapped buffer will gen-
erate anINVALID OPERATION error.
Mappings to the data stores of buffer objects may have nonstandard perfor-
mance characteristics. For example, such mappings may be marked as uncacheable
regions of memory, and in such cases reading from them may be very slow. To
ensure optimal performance, the client should use the mapping in a fashion consis-
tent with the values ofBUFFER USAGE andBUFFER ACCESS. Using a mapping in
a fashion inconsistent with these values is liable to be multiple orders of magnitude
slower than using normal memory.
After the client has speci?ed the contents of a mapped data store, and before
the data in that store are dereferenced by any GL commands, the mapping must be
relinquished by calling
boolean UnmapBuffer(enum target );
with target set to ARRAY BUFFER. Unmapping a mapped buffer object invalidates
the pointers to its data store and sets the object’s BUFFER MAPPED state to FALSE
and itsBUFFER MAP POINTER state toNULL.
UnmapBuffer returns TRUE unless data values in the buffer’s data store have
become corrupted during the period that the buffer was mapped. Such corruption
can be the result of a screen resolution change or other window-system-dependent
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.9. BUFFEROBJECTS 38
event that causes system heaps such as those for high-performance graphics mem-
ory to be discarded. GL implementations must guarantee that such corruption can
occur only during the periods that a buffer’s data store is mapped. If such corrup-
tion has occurred, UnmapBuffer returns FALSE, and the contents of the buffer’s
data store become unde?ned.
If the buffer data store is already in the unmapped state, UnmapBuffer returns
FALSE, and an INVALID OPERATION error is generated. However, unmapping
that occurs as a side effect of buffer deletion or reinitialization is not an error.
2.9.1 Vertex Arrays in Buffer Objects
Blocks of vertex array data may be stored in buffer objects with the same format
and layout options supported for client-side vertex arrays. However, it is expected
that GL implementations will (at minimum) be optimized for data with all compo-
nents represented as ?oats, as well as for color data with components represented
as either ?oats or unsigned bytes.
A buffer object binding point is added to the client state associated with
each vertex array type. The commands that specify the locations and or-
ganizations of vertex arrays copy the buffer object name that is bound to
ARRAY BUFFER to the binding point corresponding to the vertex array of the
type being speci?ed. For example, the NormalPointer command copies the
value of ARRAY BUFFER BINDING (the queriable name of the buffer bind-
ing corresponding to the target ARRAY BUFFER) to the client state variable
NORMAL ARRAY BUFFER BINDING.
Rendering commands ArrayElement, DrawArrays, DrawElements,
DrawRangeElements, MultiDrawArrays, and MultiDrawElements operate as
previously de?ned, except that data for enabled vertex and attrib arrays are sourced
from buffers if the array’s buffer binding is non-zero. When an array is sourced
from a buffer object, the pointer value of that array is used to compute an offset, in
basic machine units, into the data store of the buffer object. This offset is computed
by subtracting a null pointer from the pointer value, where both pointers are treated
as pointers to basic machine units.
It is acceptable for vertex or attrib arrays to be sourced from any combination
of client memory and various buffer objects during a single rendering operation.
Attempts to source data from a currently mapped buffer object will generate an
INVALID OPERATION error.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.10. RECTANGLES 39
2.9.2 Array Indices in Buffer Objects
Blocks of array indices may be stored in buffer objects with the same format op-
tions that are supported for client-side index arrays. Initially zero is bound to
ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER, indicating that DrawElements and DrawRangeEle-
ments are to source their indices from arrays passed as their indices parameters,
and that MultiDrawElements is to source its indices from the array of pointers to
arrays passed in as its indices parameter.
A buffer object is bound to ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER by calling BindBuffer
with target set toELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER, and buffer set to the name of the buffer
object. If no corresponding buffer object exists, one is initialized as de?ned in
section 2.9.
The commands BufferData, BufferSubData, MapBuffer, and UnmapBuffer
may all be used with target set to ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER. In such event, these
commands operate in the same fashion as described in section 2.9, but on the buffer
currently bound to theELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER target.
While a non-zero buffer object name is bound to ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER,
DrawElements and DrawRangeElements source their indices from that buffer
object, using their indices parameters as offsets into the buffer object in the same
fashion as described in section 2.9.1. MultiDrawElements also sources its in-
dices from that buffer object, using its indices parameter as a pointer to an array of
pointers that represent offsets into the buffer object.
Buffer objects created by binding an unused name to ARRAY BUFFER and to
ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER are formally equivalent, but the GL may make different
choices about storage implementation based on the initial binding. In some cases
performance will be optimized by storing indices and array data in separate buffer
objects, and by creating those buffer objects with the corresponding binding points.
2.10 Rectangles
There is a set of GL commands to support ef?cient speci?cation of rectangles as
two corner vertices.
void Rect{sifd}(T x1,T y1,T x2,T y2 );
void Rect{sifd}v(T v1[2],T v2[2] );
Each command takes either four arguments organized as two consecutive pairs of
(x,y) coordinates, or two pointers to arrays each of which contains an x value
followed by ay value. The effect of the Rect command
Rect(x ,y ,x ,y );
1 1 2 2
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 40
is exactly the same as the following sequence of commands:
Begin(POLYGON);
Vertex2(x ,y );
1 1
Vertex2(x ,y );
2 1
Vertex2(x ,y );
2 2
Vertex2(x ,y );
1 2
End();
The appropriate Vertex2 command would be invoked depending on which of the
Rect commands is issued.
2.11 Coordinate Transformations
This section and the following discussion through section 2.14 describe the state
values and operations necessary for transforming vertex attributes according to a
?xed-functionality method. An alternate programmable method for transforming
vertex attributes is described in section 2.15.
Vertices, normals, and texture coordinates are transformed before their coordi-
nates are used to produce an image in the framebuffer. We begin with a description
of how vertex coordinates are transformed and how this transformation is con-
trolled.
Figure 2.6 diagrams the sequence of transformations that are applied to ver-
tices. The vertex coordinates that are presented to the GL are termed object co-
ordinates. The model-view matrix is applied to these coordinates to yield eye co-
ordinates. Then another matrix, called the projection matrix, is applied to eye
coordinates to yield clip coordinates. A perspective division is carried out on clip
coordinates to yield normalized device coordinates. A ?nal viewport transforma-
tion is applied to convert these coordinates into window coordinates.
Object coordinates, eye coordinates, and clip coordinates are four-dimensional,
consisting ofx, y, z, andw coordinates (in that order). The model-view and pro-
jection matrices are thus4? 4.

2.11.1 Controlling the Viewport

pixels,p andp , respectively, and its center(o ,o ) (also in pixels). The vertex’s

Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 42
void DepthRange(clampd n,clampd f );
Each of n and f are clamped to lie within[0,1], as are all arguments of typeclampd
orclampf. z is taken to be represented in ?xed-point with at least as many bits
w
as there are in the depth buffer of the framebuffer. We assume that the ?xed-point
m m
representation used represents each valuek/(2 ? 1), wherek?{0,1,...,2 ?
1}, ask (e.g. 1.0 is represented in binary as a string of all ones).
Viewport transformation parameters are speci?ed using
void Viewport(int x,int y,sizei w,sizei h );
where x and y give the x and y window coordinates of the viewport’s lower left
corner and w and h give the viewport’s width and height, respectively. The viewport
parameters shown in the above equations are found from these values as o =
x
x+w/2 ando =y +h/2;p =w,p =h.
y x y
Viewport width and height are clamped to implementation-dependent maxi-
mums when speci?ed. The maximum width and height may be found by issuing
an appropriate Get command (see chapter 6). The maximum viewport dimensions
must be greater than or equal to the visible dimensions of the display being ren-
dered to. INVALID VALUE is generated if either w or h is negative.
The state required to implement the viewport transformation is four integers
and two clamped ?oating-point values. In the initial state, w and h are set to the
width and height, respectively, of the window into which the GL is to do its ren-
dering. o ando are set tow/2 andh/2, respectively. n andf are set to 0.0 and
x y
1.0, respectively.
2.11.2 Matrices
The projection matrix and model-view matrix are set and modi?ed with a variety
of commands. The affected matrix is determined by the current matrix mode. The
current matrix mode is set with
void MatrixMode(enum mode );
which takes one of the pre-de?ned constants TEXTURE, MODELVIEW, COLOR, or
PROJECTION as the argument value. TEXTURE is described later in section 2.11.2,
andCOLOR is described in section 3.6.3. If the current matrix mode isMODELVIEW,
then matrix operations apply to the model-view matrix; ifPROJECTION, then they
apply to the projection matrix.
The two basic commands for affecting the current matrix are
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 43
void LoadMatrix{fd}(T m[16] );
void MultMatrix{fd}(T m[16] );
LoadMatrix takes a pointer to a 4? 4 matrix stored in column-major order as 16
consecutive ?oating-point values, i.e. as
? ?
a a a a
1 5 9 13
? ?
a a a a
2 6 10 14
? ?
.
? ?
a a a a

4 8 12 16
(This differs from the standard row-major C ordering for matrix elements. If the
standard ordering is used, all of the subsequent transformation equations are trans-
posed, and the columns representing vectors become rows.)
The speci?ed matrix replaces the current matrix with the one pointed to. Mult-
Matrix takes the same type argument as LoadMatrix, but multiplies the current
matrix by the one pointed to and replaces the current matrix with the product. IfC
is the current matrix and M is the matrix pointed to by MultMatrix’s argument,
0
then the resulting current matrix,C , is
0
C =C· M.
The commands
void LoadTransposeMatrix{fd}(T m[16] );
void MultTransposeMatrix{fd}(T m[16] );
take pointers to4? 4 matrices stored in row-major order as 16 consecutive ?oating-
point values, i.e. as

The effect of

There are a variety of other commands that manipulate matrices. Rotate,
Translate, Scale, Frustum, and Ortho manipulate the current matrix. Each com-
putes a matrix and then invokes MultMatrix with this matrix. In the case of
void Rotate{fd}(T? ,T x,T y,T z );
? gives an angle of rotation in degrees; the coordinates of a vectorv are given by
T
v = (xyz) . The computed matrix is a counter-clockwise rotation about the line
through the origin with the speci?ed axis when that axis is pointing up (i.e. the
right-hand rule determines the sense of the rotation angle). The matrix is thus

where the left matrix is the current texture matrix. The matrix is applied to the
coordinates resulting from texture coordinate generation (which may simply be the
current texture coordinates), and the resulting transformed coordinates become the
texture coordinates associated with a vertex. Setting the matrix mode toTEXTURE
causes the already described matrix operations to apply to the texture matrix.
The command
void ActiveTexture(enum texture );
speci?es the active texture unit selector,ACTIVE TEXTURE. Each texture unit con-
tains up to two distinct sub-units: a texture coordinate processing unit (consisting
of a texture matrix stack and texture coordinate generation state) and a texture
image unit (consisting of all the texture state de?ned in section 3.8). In implemen-
tations with a different number of supported texture coordinate sets and texture
image units, some texture units may consist of only one of the two sub-units.
The active texture unit selector speci?es the texture coordinate set accessed
by commands involving texture coordinate processing. Such commands include
those accessing the current matrix stack (if MATRIX MODE is TEXTURE), TexEnv
commands controlling point sprite coordinate replacement (see section 3.3), Tex-
Gen (section 2.11.4), Enable/Disable (if any texture coordinate generation enum
is selected), as well as queries of the current texture coordinates and current raster
texture coordinates. If the texture coordinate set number corresponding to the cur-
rent value of ACTIVE TEXTURE is greater than or equal to the implementation-
dependent constant MAX TEXTURE COORDS, the error INVALID OPERATION is
generated by any such command.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 47
The active texture unit selector also selects the texture image unit accessed
by commands involving texture image processing (section 3.8). Such commands
include all variants of TexEnv (except for those controlling point sprite coordi-
nate replacement), TexParameter, and TexImage commands, BindTexture, En-
able/Disable for any texture target (e.g., TEXTURE 2D), and queries of all such
state. If the texture image unit number corresponding to the current value of
ACTIVE TEXTURE is greater than or equal to the implementation-dependent con-
stantMAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS, the errorINVALID OPERATION is
generated by any such command.
ActiveTexture generates the errorINVALID ENUM if an invalid texture is spec-
i?ed. texture is a symbolic constant of the form TEXTUREi, indicating that tex-
ture unit i is to be modi?ed. The constants obey TEXTUREi = TEXTURE0 +i (i
is in the range 0 to k? 1, where k is the larger of MAX TEXTURE COORDS and
MAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS).
For backwards compatibility, the implementation-dependent
constant MAX TEXTURE UNITS speci?es the number of conventional texture units
supported by the implementation. Its value must be no larger than the minimum of
MAX TEXTURE COORDS andMAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS.
There is a stack of matrices for each of matrix modes MODELVIEW,
PROJECTION, and COLOR, and for each texture unit. For MODELVIEW mode, the
stack depth is at least 32 (that is, there is a stack of at least 32 model-view ma-
trices). For the other modes, the depth is at least 2. Texture matrix stacks for all
texture units have the same depth. The current matrix in any mode is the matrix on
the top of the stack for that mode.
void PushMatrix(void );
pushes the stack down by one, duplicating the current matrix in both the top of the
stack and the entry below it.
void PopMatrix(void );
pops the top entry off of the stack, replacing the current matrix with the matrix
that was the second entry in the stack. The pushing or popping takes place on the
stack corresponding to the current matrix mode. Popping a matrix off a stack with
only one entry generates the errorSTACK UNDERFLOW; pushing a matrix onto a full
stack generatesSTACK OVERFLOW.
When the current matrix mode is TEXTURE, the texture matrix stack of the
active texture unit is pushed or popped.
The state required to implement transformations consists of an integer for
the active texture unit selector, a four-valued integer indicating the current matrix
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 48
mode, one stack of at least two 4? 4 matrices for each of COLOR, PROJECTION,
and each texture coordinate set,TEXTURE; and a stack of at least 324? 4 matrices
forMODELVIEW. Each matrix stack has an associated stack pointer. Initially, there
is only one matrix on each stack, and all matrices are set to the identity. The
initial active texture unit selector is TEXTURE0, and the initial matrix mode is
MODELVIEW.
2.11.3 Normal Transformation
Finally, we consider how the model-view matrix and transformation state affect
normals. Before use in lighting, normals are transformed to eye coordinates by a
matrix derived from the model-view matrix. Rescaling and normalization opera-
tions are performed on the transformed normals to make them unit length prior to
use in lighting. Rescaling and normalization are controlled by
void Enable(enum target );
and
void Disable(enum target );
with target equal to RESCALE NORMAL or NORMALIZE. This requires two bits of
state. The initial state is for normals not to be rescaled or normalized.
If the model-view matrix isM, then the normal is transformed to eye coordi-
nates by:

Note that if the normals sent to GL were unit length and the model-view matrix
uniformly scales space, then rescale makes the transformed normals unit length.
Alternatively, an implementation may choose f as

f =

recomputingf for each normal. This makes all non-zero length normals unit length
regardless of their input length and the nature of the model-view matrix.
After rescaling, the ?nal transformed normal used in lighting,n , is computed

Because we specify neither the ?oating-point format nor the means for matrix
inversion, we cannot specify behavior in the case of a poorly-conditioned (nearly
singular) model-view matrix M. In case of an exactly singular matrix, the trans-
formed normal is unde?ned. If the GL implementation determines that the model-
view matrix is uninvertible, then the entries in the inverted matrix are arbitrary. In
any case, neither normal transformation nor use of the transformed normal may
lead to GL interruption or termination.
2.11.4 Generating Texture Coordinates
Texture coordinates associated with a vertex may either be taken from the current
texture coordinates or generated according to a function dependent on vertex coor-
dinates. The command
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.11. COORDINATETRANSFORMATIONS 50
void TexGen{ifd}(enum coord,enum pname,T param );
void TexGen{ifd}v(enum coord,enum pname,T params );
controls texture coordinate generation. coord must be one of the constants S, T,
R, or Q, indicating that the pertinent coordinate is the s, t, r, or q coordinate, re-
spectively. In the ?rst form of the command, param is a symbolic constant speci-
fying a single-valued texture generation parameter; in the second form, params is
a pointer to an array of values that specify texture generation parameters. pname
must be one of the three symbolic constantsTEXTURE GEN MODE,OBJECT PLANE,
or EYE PLANE. If pname is TEXTURE GEN MODE, then either params points to
or param is an integer that is one of the symbolic constants OBJECT LINEAR,
EYE LINEAR,SPHERE MAP,REFLECTION MAP, orNORMAL MAP.
If TEXTURE GEN MODE indicates OBJECT LINEAR, then the generation func-
tion for the coordinate indicated by coord is
g =p x +p y +p z +p w .
1 o 2 o 3 o 4 o
x ,y ,z , andw are the object coordinates of the vertex. p ,...,p are speci?ed

by calling TexGen with pname set toOBJECT PLANE in which case params points
to an array containing p ,...,p . There is a distinct group of plane equation co-
1 4
ef?cients for each texture coordinate; coord indicates the coordinate to which the
speci?ed coef?cients pertain.
IfTEXTURE GEN MODE indicatesEYE LINEAR, then the function is

x , y , z , and w are the eye coordinates of the vertex. p ,...,p are set by
e e e e 1 4
calling TexGen with pname set to EYE PLANE in correspondence with setting the
coef?cients in the OBJECT PLANE case. M is the model-view matrix in effect
whenp ,...,p are speci?ed. Computed texture coordinates may be inaccurate or

unde?ned ifM is poorly conditioned or singular.
When used with a suitably constructed texture image, calling TexGen with
TEXTURE GEN MODE indicating SPHERE MAP can simulate the re?ected image of
a spherical environment on a polygon. SPHERE MAP texture coordinates are gen-
erated as follows. Denote the unit vector pointing from the origin to the vertex
(in eye coordinates) byu. Denote the current normal, after transformation to eye

A texture coordinate generation function is enabled or disabled using En-
able and Disable with an argument of TEXTURE GEN S, TEXTURE GEN T,
TEXTURE GEN R, orTEXTURE GEN Q (each indicates the corresponding texture co-
ordinate). When enabled, the speci?ed texture coordinate is computed according
to the current EYE LINEAR, OBJECT LINEAR or SPHERE MAP speci?cation, de-
pending on the current setting of TEXTURE GEN MODE for that coordinate. When
disabled, subsequent vertices will take the indicated texture coordinate from the
current texture coordinates.
The state required for texture coordinate generation for each texture unit com-
prises a ?ve-valued integer for each coordinate indicating coordinate generation
mode, and a bit for each coordinate to indicate whether texture coordinate genera-
tion is enabled or disabled. In addition, four coef?cients are required for the four
coordinates for each ofEYE LINEAR andOBJECT LINEAR. The initial state has the
texture generation function disabled for all texture coordinates. The initial values
ofp fors are all 0 exceptp which is one; fort all thep are zero exceptp , which

areEYE LINEAR.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.12. CLIPPING 52
2.12 Clipping
Primitives are clipped to the clip volume. In clip coordinates, the view volume is
de?ned by
? w ? x ? w
c c c
? w ? y ? w
c c c
? w ? z ? w .
c c c
This view volume may be further restricted by as many as n client-de?ned clip
planes to generate the clip volume. (n is an implementation dependent maximum
that must be at least 6.) Each client-de?ned plane speci?es a half-space. The clip
volume is the intersection of all such half-spaces with the view volume (if there no
client-de?ned clip planes are enabled, the clip volume is the view volume).
A client-de?ned clip plane is speci?ed with
void ClipPlane(enum p,double eqn[4] );
The value of the ?rst argument, p, is a symbolic constant,CLIP PLANEi, wherei is
an integer between 0 andn? 1, indicating one ofn client-de?ned clip planes. eqn
is an array of four double-precision ?oating-point values. These are the coef?cients
of a plane equation in object coordinates: p , p , p , and p (in that order). The
1 2 3 4
inverse of the current model-view matrix is applied to these coef?cients, at the time
they are speci?ed, yielding

When a vertex shader is active, the vector (x y z w ) is no longer

computed. Instead, the value of thegl ClipVertex built-in variable is used in its
place. Ifgl ClipVertex is not written by the vertex shader, its value is unde?ned,
which implies that the results of clipping to any client-de?ned clip planes are also
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.12. CLIPPING 53
unde?ned. The user must ensure that the clip vertex and client-de?ned clip planes
are de?ned in the same coordinate space.
Client-de?ned clip planes are enabled with the generic Enable command and
disabled with the Disable command. The value of the argument to either com-
mand is CLIP PLANEi where i is an integer between 0 and n; specifying a value
of i enables or disables the plane equation with index i. The constants obey
CLIP PLANEi = CLIP PLANE0+i.
If the primitive under consideration is a point, then clipping passes it un-
changed if it lies within the clip volume; otherwise, it is discarded. If the prim-
itive is a line segment, then clipping does nothing to it if it lies entirely within the
clip volume and discards it if it lies entirely outside the volume. If part of the line
segment lies in the volume and part lies outside, then the line segment is clipped
and new vertex coordinates are computed for one or both vertices. A clipped line
segment endpoint lies on both the original line segment and the boundary of the
clip volume.
This clipping produces a value, 0? t? 1, for each clipped vertex. If the
coordinates of a clipped vertex areP and the original vertices’ coordinates areP
1
andP , thent is given by
2
P =tP +(1? t)P .
1 2
The value oft is used in color, secondary color, texture coordinate, and fog coor-
dinate clipping (section 2.14.8).
If the primitive is a polygon, then it is passed if every one of its edges lies
entirely inside the clip volume and either clipped or discarded otherwise. Polygon
clipping may cause polygon edges to be clipped, but because polygon connectivity
must be maintained, these clipped edges are connected by new edges that lie along
the clip volume’s boundary. Thus, clipping may require the introduction of new
vertices into a polygon. Edge ?ags are associated with these vertices so that edges
introduced by clipping are ?agged as boundary (edge ?agTRUE), and so that orig-
inal edges of the polygon that become cut off at these vertices retain their original
?ags.
If it happens that a polygon intersects an edge of the clip volume’s boundary,
then the clipped polygon must include a point on this boundary edge. This point
must lie in the intersection of the boundary edge and the convex hull of the vertices
of the original polygon. We impose this requirement because the polygon may not
be exactly planar.
A line segment or polygon whose vertices have w values of differing signs
c
may generate multiple connected components after clipping. GL implementations
are not required to handle this situation. That is, only the portion of the primitive
that lies in the region ofw > 0 need be produced by clipping.
c
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.13. CURRENTRASTERPOSITION 54
Primitives rendered with clip planes must satisfy a complementarity crite-
0 0 0 0
rion. Suppose a single clip plane with coef?cients (p p p p ) (or a num-
1 2 3 4
ber of similarly speci?ed clip planes) is enabled and a series of primitives are
drawn. Next, suppose that the original clip plane is respeci?ed with coef?cients
0 0 0 0
(? p ? p ? p ? p ) (and correspondingly for any other clip planes) and
1 2 3 4
the primitives are drawn again (and the GL is otherwise in the same state). In this
case, primitives must not be missing any pixels, nor may any pixels be drawn twice
in regions where those primitives are cut by the clip planes.
The state required for clipping is at least 6 sets of plane equations (each consist-
ing of four double-precision ?oating-point coef?cients) and at least 6 correspond-
ing bits indicating which of these client-de?ned plane equations are enabled. In the
initial state, all client-de?ned plane equation coef?cients are zero and all planes are
disabled.
2.13 Current Raster Position
The current raster position is used by commands that directly affect pixels in the
framebuffer. These commands, which bypass vertex transformation and primitive
assembly, are described in the next chapter. The current raster position, however,
shares some of the characteristics of a vertex.
The current raster position is set using one of the commands
void RasterPos{234}{sifd}(T coords );
void RasterPos{234}{sifd}v(T coords );
RasterPos4 takes four values indicating x, y, z, and w. RasterPos3 (or Raster-
Pos2) is analogous, but sets onlyx, y, andz withw implicitly set to 1 (or onlyx
andy withz implicitly set to0 andw implicitly set to1).
Gets ofCURRENT RASTER TEXTURE COORDS are affected by the setting of the
stateACTIVE TEXTURE.
The coordinates are treated as if they were speci?ed in a Vertex command. If
a vertex shader is active, this vertex shader is executed using the x, y, z, and w
coordinates as the object coordinates of the vertex. Otherwise, the x, y, z, and
w coordinates are transformed by the current model-view and projection matri-
ces. These coordinates, along with current values, are used to generate primary
and secondary colors and texture coordinates just as is done for a vertex. The col-
ors and texture coordinates so produced replace the colors and texture coordinates
stored in the current raster position’s associated data. If a vertex shader is active
then the current raster distance is set to the value of the shader built in varying
gl FogFragCoord. Otherwise, if the value of the fog source (see section 3.10)
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.13. CURRENTRASTERPOSITION 55
is FOG COORD, then the current raster distance is set to the value of the current
fog coordinate. Otherwise, the current raster distance is set to the distance from
the origin of the eye coordinate system to the vertex as transformed by only the
current model-view matrix. This distance may be approximated as discussed in
section 3.10.
Since vertex shaders may be executed when the raster position is set, any at-
tributes not written by the shader will result in unde?ned state in the current raster
position. Vertex shaders should output all varying variables that would be used
when rasterizing pixel primitives using the current raster position.
The transformed coordinates are passed to clipping as if they represented a
point. If the “point” is not culled, then the projection to window coordinates is
computed (section 2.11) and saved as the current raster position, and the valid
bit is set. If the “point” is culled, the current raster position and its associated
data become indeterminate and the valid bit is cleared. Figure 2.7 summarizes the
behavior of the current raster position.
Alternately, the current raster position may be set by one of the WindowPos
commands:
void WindowPos{23}{ifds}(T coords );
void WindowPos{23}{ifds}v(const T coords );
WindowPos3 takes three values indicating x, y and z, while WindowPos2
takes two values indicating x and y with z implicitly set to 0. The current raster
position,(x ,y ,z ,w ), is de?ned by:
w w w c
x =x

not performed by the WindowPos functions. Instead, in RGBA mode, the current

raster color and secondary color are obtained by clamping each component of the
current color and secondary color, respectively, to [0,1]. In color index mode, the
current raster color index is set to the current color index. The current raster texture
coordinates are set to the current texture coordinates, and the valid bit is set.
If the value of the fog source is FOG COORD SRC, then the current raster dis-
tance is set to the value of the current fog coordinate. Otherwise, the raster distance
is set to0.
The current raster position requires six single-precision ?oating-point values
for itsx ,y , andz window coordinates, itsw clip coordinate, its raster distance
w w w c
(used as the fog coordinate in raster processing), a single valid bit, four ?oating-
point values to store the current RGBA color, four ?oating-point values to store the
current RGBA secondary color, one ?oating-point value to store the current color
index, and 4 ?oating-point values for texture coordinates for each texture unit. In
the initial state, the coordinates and texture coordinates are all (0,0,0,1), the eye
coordinate distance is 0, the fog coordinate is 0, the valid bit is set, the associated
RGBA color is(1,1,1,1), the associated RGBA secondary color is(0,0,0,1), and
the associated color index color is 1. In RGBA mode, the associated color index
always has its initial value; in color index mode, the RGBA color and secondary
color always maintain their initial values.
2.14 Colors and Coloring
Figures 2.8 and 2.9 diagram the processing of RGBA colors and color indices be-
fore rasterization. Incoming colors arrive in one of several formats. Table 2.9 sum-
marizes the conversions that take place on R, G, B, and A components depending
on which version of the Color command was invoked to specify the components.
As a result of limited precision, some converted values will not be represented
exactly. In color index mode, a single-valued color index is not mapped.
Next, lighting, if enabled, produces either a color index or primary and sec-
ondary colors. If lighting is disabled, the current color index or current color
(primary color) and current secondary color are used in further processing. After
lighting, RGBA colors are clamped to the range [0,1]. A color index is converted
to ?xed-point and then its integer portion is masked (see section 2.14.6). After
clamping or masking, a primitive may be ?atshaded, indicating that all vertices of
the primitive are to have the same colors. Finally, if a primitive is clipped, then
colors (and texture coordinates) must be computed at the vertices introduced or
modi?ed by clipping.

Table 2.9: Component conversions. Color, normal, and depth components, (c),
are converted to an internal ?oating-point representation, (f), using the equations
in this table. All arithmetic is done in the internal ?oating point format. These
conversions apply to components speci?ed as parameters to GL commands and to
components in pixel data. The equations remain the same even if the implemented
ranges of the GL data types are greater than the minimum required ranges. (Refer
to table 2.2)
2.14.1 Lighting
GL lighting computes colors for each vertex sent to the GL. This is accomplished
by applying an equation de?ned by a client-speci?ed lighting model to a collection
of parameters that can include the vertex coordinates, the coordinates of one or
more light sources, the current normal, and parameters de?ning the characteristics
of the light sources and a current material. The following discussion assumes that
the GL is in RGBA mode. (Color index lighting is described in section 2.14.5.)
Lighting is turned on or off using the generic Enable or Disable commands
with the symbolic value LIGHTING. If lighting is off, the current color and cur-
rent secondary color are assigned to the vertex primary and secondary color, re-
spectively. If lighting is on, colors computed computed from the current lighting
parameters are assigned to the vertex primary and secondary colors.
Lighting Operation
A lighting parameter is of one of ?ve types: color, position, direction, real, or
boolean. A color parameter consists of four ?oating-point values, one for each of
R, G, B, and A, in that order. There are no restrictions on the allowable values for
these parameters. A position parameter consists of four ?oating-point coordinates
(x, y, z, and w) that specify a position in object coordinates (w may be zero,
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.14. COLORSANDCOLORING 60
indicating a point at in?nity in the direction given by x, y, and z). A direction
parameter consists of three ?oating-point coordinates (x, y, and z) that specify a
direction in object coordinates. A real parameter is one ?oating-point value. The
various values and their types are summarized in table 2.10. The result of a lighting
computation is unde?ned if a value for a parameter is speci?ed that is outside the
range given for that parameter in the table.
There aren light sources, indexed byi = 0,...,n? 1. (n is an implementation
dependent maximum that must be at least 8.) Note that the default values ford

Before specifying the way that lighting computes colors, we introduce oper-
ators and notation that simplify the expressions involved. If c and c are col-

ors without alpha where c = (r ,g ,b ) and c = (r ,g ,b ), then de?ne
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
c ? c = (r r ,g g ,b b ). Addition of colors is accomplished by addition of

the components. Multiplication of colors by a scalar means multiplying each com-
ponent by that scalar. Ifd andd are directions, then de?ne

A is always associated with the primary colorc ; the alpha component ofc is

Results of lighting are unde?ned if thew coordinate (w in eye coordinates) of

V is zero.
Lighting may operate in two-sided mode (t = TRUE), in which a front color
bs
is computed with one set of material parameters (the front material) and a back
color is computed with a second set of material parameters (the back material).
This second computation replacesn with? n. Ift = FALSE, then the back color
bs
and front color are both assigned the color computed using the front material with
n.
Additionally, vertex shaders can operate in two-sided color mode. When a ver-
tex shader is active, front and back colors can be computed by the vertex shader and
written to the gl FrontColor, gl BackColor, gl FrontSecondaryColor
and gl BackSecondaryColor outputs. If VERTEX PROGRAM TWO SIDE is en-
abled, the GL chooses between front and back colors, as described below. Oth-
erwise, the front color output is always selected. Two-sided color mode is
enabled and disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the symbolic value
VERTEX PROGRAM TWO SIDE.
The selection between back and front colors depends on the primitive of which
the vertex being lit is a part. If the primitive is a point or a line segment, the front
color is always selected. If it is a polygon, then the selection is based on the sign of
the (clipped or unclipped) polygon’s signed area computed in window coordinates.
One way to compute this area is

where x and y are the x and y window coordinates of the ith vertex of the

n-vertex polygon (vertices are numbered starting at zero for purposes of this com-
putation) andi? 1 is(i+1) modn. The interpretation of the sign of this value is
controlled with
void FrontFace(enum dir );
Setting dir toCCW (corresponding to counter-clockwise orientation of the projected
polygon in window coordinates) indicates that if a? 0, then the color of each
vertex of the polygon becomes the back color computed for that vertex while if
a> 0, then the front color is selected. If dir isCW, thena is replaced by? a in the
above inequalities. This requires one bit of state; initially, it indicatesCCW.

void LightModel{if}(enum pname,T param );
void LightModel{if}v(enum pname,T params );
pname is a symbolic constant indicating which parameter is to be set (see ta-
ble 2.11). In the vector versions of the commands, params is a pointer to a group
of values to which to set the indicated parameter. The number of values pointed to
depends on the parameter being set. In the non-vector versions, param is a value to
which to set a single-valued parameter. (If param corresponds to a multi-valued pa-
rameter, the errorINVALID ENUM results.) For the Material command, face must
be one ofFRONT,BACK, orFRONT AND BACK, indicating that the property name of
the front or back material, or both, respectively, should be set. In the case of Light,
light is a symbolic constant of the form LIGHTi, indicating that light i is to have
the speci?ed parameter set. The constants obeyLIGHTi = LIGHT0+i.
2.11 gives, for each of the three parameter groups, the correspondence
Table
between the pre-de?ned constant names and their names in the lighting equations,
along with the number of values that must be speci?ed with each. Color param-
eters speci?ed with Material and Light are converted to ?oating-point values
(if speci?ed as integers) as indicated in table 2.9 for signed integers. The error
INVALID VALUE occurs if a speci?ed lighting parameter lies outside the allowable
range given in table 2.10. (The symbol “?” indicates the maximum representable
magnitude for the indicated type.)
Material properties can be changed inside a Begin/End pair by calling Ma-
terial. However, when a vertex shader is active such property changes are not
guaranteed to update material parameters, de?ned in table 2.11, until the following
End command.
The current model-view matrix is applied to the position parameter indicated
with Light for a particular light source when that position is speci?ed. These
transformed values are the values used in the lighting equation.
The spotlight direction is transformed when it is speci?ed using only the upper
leftmost 3x3 portion of the model-view matrix. That is, ifM is the upper left 3x3

An individual light is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the
symbolic valueLIGHTi (i is in the range 0 ton? 1, wheren is the implementation-
dependent number of lights). If light i is disabled, the ith term in the lighting
equation is effectively removed from the summation.
2.14.3 ColorMaterial
It is possible to attach one or more material properties to the current color, so
that they continuously track its component values. This behavior is enabled and
disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the symbolic valueCOLOR MATERIAL.
The command that controls which of these modes is selected is
void ColorMaterial(enum face,enum mode );
face is one of FRONT, BACK, or FRONT AND BACK, indicating whether the front
material, back material, or both are affected by the current color. mode is one
of EMISSION, AMBIENT, DIFFUSE, SPECULAR, or AMBIENT AND DIFFUSE and
speci?es which material property or properties track the current color. If mode is
EMISSION,AMBIENT,DIFFUSE, orSPECULAR, then the value ofe ,a ,d or
cm cm cm
s , respectively, will track the current color. If mode isAMBIENT AND DIFFUSE,
cm
botha andd track the current color. The replacements made to material prop-
cm cm
erties are permanent; the replaced values remain until changed by either sending a
new color or by setting a new material value when ColorMaterial is not currently
enabled to override that particular value. When COLOR MATERIAL is enabled, the
indicated parameter or parameters always track the current color. For instance,
calling
ColorMaterial(FRONT,AMBIENT)
while COLOR MATERIAL is enabled sets the front materiala to the value of the
cm
current color.
Material properties can be changed inside a Begin/End pair indirectly by en-
abling ColorMaterial mode and making Color calls. However, when a vertex

shader is active such property changes are not guaranteed to update material pa-
rameters, de?ned in table 2.11, until the following End command.
2.14.4 Lighting State
The state required for lighting consists of all of the lighting parameters (front
and back material parameters, lighting model parameters, and at least 8 sets of
light parameters), a bit indicating whether a back color distinct from the front
color should be computed, at least 8 bits to indicate which lights are enabled,
a ?ve-valued variable indicating the current ColorMaterial mode, a bit indicat-
ing whether or not COLOR MATERIAL is enabled, and a single bit to indicate
whether lighting is enabled or disabled. In the initial state, all lighting parame-
ters have their default values. Back color evaluation does not take place, Color-
Material isFRONT AND BACK andAMBIENT AND DIFFUSE, and both lighting and
COLOR MATERIAL are disabled.
2.14.5 Color Index Lighting
A simpli?ed lighting computation applies in color index mode that uses many of
the parameters controlling RGBA lighting, but none of the RGBA material param-
eters. First, the RGBA diffuse and specular intensities of light i (d and s ,
cli cli
respectively) determine color index diffuse and specular light intensities, d and
li
s from
li
d = (.30)R(d )+(.59)G(d )+(.11)B(d )

and
s = (.30)R(s )+(.59)G(s )+(.11)B(s ).
li cli cli cli
R(x) indicates the R component of the colorx and similarly forG(x) andB(x).
Next, let

m m m
COLOR INDEXES. Their initial values are 0, 1, and 1, respectively. The additional
state consists of three ?oating-point values. These values have no effect on RGBA
lighting.
2.14.6 Clamping or Masking
After lighting (whether enabled or not), all components of both primary and sec-
ondary colors are clamped to the range[0,1].
For a color index, the index is ?rst converted to ?xed-point with an unspeci?ed
number of bits to the right of the binary point; the nearest ?xed-point value is
selected. Then, the bits to the right of the binary point are left alone while the
n
integer portion is masked (bitwise ANDed) with2 ? 1, wheren is the number of
bits in a color in the color index buffer (buffers are discussed in chapter 4).
2.14.7 Flatshading
A primitive may be ?atshaded, meaning that all vertices of the primitive are as-
signed the same color index or the same primary and secondary colors. These
colors are the colors of the vertex that spawned the primitive. For a point, these
are the colors associated with the point. For a line segment, they are the colors of
the second (?nal) vertex of the segment. For a polygon, they come from a selected
vertex depending on how the polygon was generated. Table 2.12 summarizes the
possibilities.
Flatshading is controlled by
void ShadeModel(enum mode );
mode value must be either of the symbolic constants SMOOTH or FLAT. If mode is
SMOOTH (the initial state), vertex colors are treated individually. If mode is FLAT,
?atshading is turned on. ShadeModel thus requires one bit of state.

current color (if lighting is disabled) in effect when the indicated vertex is speci?ed.
If lighting is enabled, the colors are produced by lighting the indicated vertex.
Vertices are numbered1 throughn, wheren is the number of vertices between the
Begin/End pair.
2.14.8 Color and Associated Data Clipping
After lighting, clamping or masking and possible ?atshading, colors are clipped.
Those colors associated with a vertex that lies within the clip volume are unaffected
by clipping. If a primitive is clipped, however, the colors assigned to vertices
produced by clipping are clipped colors.
Let the colors assigned to the two verticesP andP of an unclipped edge be
1 2
c andc . The value oft (section 2.12) for a clipped pointP is used to obtain the
1 2
color associated withP as
c =tc +(1? t)c .
1 2
(For a color index color, multiplying a color by a scalar means multiplying the
index by the scalar. For an RGBA color, it means multiplying each of R, G, B, and
A by the scalar. Both primary and secondary colors are treated in the same fashion.)
Polygon clipping may create a clipped vertex along an edge of the clip volume’s
boundary. This situation is handled by noting that polygon clipping proceeds by
clipping against one plane of the clip volume’s boundary at a time. Color clipping
is done in the same way, so that clipped points always occur at the intersection of
polygon edges (possibly already clipped) with the clip volume’s boundary.
Texture and fog coordinates, vertex shader varying variables (section 2.15.3),
and point sizes computed on a per vertex basis must also be clipped when a primi-
tive is clipped. The method is exactly analogous to that used for color clipping.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 71
2.14.9 Final Color Processing
For an RGBA color, each color component (which lies in [0,1]) is converted
(by rounding to nearest) to a ?xed-point value with m bits. We assume that
m
the ?xed-point representation used represents each value k/(2 ? 1), where
m
k ? {0,1,...,2 ? 1}, as k (e.g. 1.0 is represented in binary as a string of
all ones). m must be at least as large as the number of bits in the corresponding
component of the framebuffer. m must be at least 2 for A if the framebuffer does
not contain an A component, or if there is only 1 bit of A in the framebuffer. A
color index is converted (by rounding to nearest) to a ?xed-point value with at least
as many bits as there are in the color index portion of the framebuffer.
m
Because a number of the formk/(2 ? 1) may not be represented exactly as
a limited-precision ?oating-point quantity, we place a further requirement on the
?xed-point conversion of RGBA components. Suppose that lighting is disabled, the
color associated with a vertex has not been clipped, and one of Colorub, Colorus,
or Colorui was used to specify that color. When these conditions are satis?ed, an
RGBA component must convert to a value that matches the component as speci?ed
in the Color command: if m is less than the number of bits b with which the
component was speci?ed, then the converted value must equal the most signi?cant
m bits of the speci?ed value; otherwise, the most signi?cantb bits of the converted
value must equal the speci?ed value.
2.15 Vertex Shaders
The sequence of operations described in sections 2.11 through 2.14 is a ?xed-
function method for processing vertex data. Applications can more generally de-
scribe the operations that occur on vertex values and their associated data by using
a vertex shader.
A vertex shader is an array of strings containing source code for the operations
that are meant to occur on each vertex that is processed. The language used for
vertex shaders is described in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
To use a vertex shader, shader source code is ?rst loaded into a shader object
and then compiled. One or more vertex shader objects are then attached to a pro-
gram object. A program object is then linked, which generates executable code
from all the compiled shader objects attached to to the program. When a linked
program object is used as the current program object, the executable code for the
vertex shaders it contains is used to process vertices.
In addition to vertex shaders, fragment shaders can be created, compiled, and
linked into program objects. Fragment shaders affect the processing of fragments
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 72
during rasterization, and are described in section 3.11. A single program object
can contain both vertex and fragment shaders.
When the program object currently in use includes a vertex shader, its vertex
shader is considered active and is used to process vertices. If the program object
has no vertex shader, or no program object is currently in use, the ?xed-function
method for processing vertices is used instead.
2.15.1 Shader Objects
The source code that makes up a program that gets executed by one of the pro-
grammable stages is encapsulated in one or more shader objects.
The name space for shader objects is the unsigned integers, with zero re-
served for the GL. This name space is shared with program objects. The following
sections de?ne commands that operate on shader and program objects by name.
Commands that accept shader or program object names will generate the error
INVALID VALUE if the provided name is not the name of either a shader or pro-
gram object and INVALID OPERATION if the provided name identi?es an object
that is not the expected type.
To create a shader object, use the command
uint CreateShader(enum type );
The shader object is empty when it is created. The type argument speci?es the type
of shader object to be created. For vertex shaders, type must beVERTEX SHADER.
A non-zero name that can be used to reference the shader object is returned. If an
error occurs, zero will be returned.
The command
void ShaderSource(uint shader,sizei count,const
char **string,const int *length );
loads source code into the shader object named shader. string is an array of count
pointers to optionally null-terminated character strings that make up the source
code. The length argument is an array with the number ofchars in each string (the
string length). If an element in length is negative, its accompanying string is null-
terminated. If length isNULL, all strings in the string argument are considered null-
terminated. The ShaderSource command sets the source code for the shader to
the text strings in the string array. If shader previously had source code loaded into
it, the existing source code is completely replaced. Any length passed in excludes
the null terminator in its count.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 73
The strings that are loaded into a shader object are expected to form the source
code for a valid shader as de?ned in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
Once the source code for a shader has been loaded, a shader object can be
compiled with the command
void CompileShader(uint shader );
Each shader object has a boolean status, COMPILE STATUS, that is modi?ed as
a result of compilation. This status can be queried with GetShaderiv (see sec-
tion 6.1.14). This status will be set toTRUE if shader was compiled without errors
and is ready for use, and FALSE otherwise. Compilation can fail for a variety of
reasons as listed in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. If Compile-
Shader failed, any information about a previous compile is lost. Thus a failed
compile does not restore the old state of shader.
Changing the source code of a shader object with ShaderSource does not
change its compile status or the compiled shader code.
Each shader object has an information log, which is a text string that is over-
written as a result of compilation. This information log can be queried with Get-
ShaderInfoLog to obtain more information about the compilation attempt (see
section 6.1.14).
Shader objects can be deleted with the command
void DeleteShader(uint shader );
If shader is not attached to any program object, it is deleted immediately. Oth-
erwise, shader is ?agged for deletion and will be deleted when it is no longer
attached to any program object. If an object is ?agged for deletion, its boolean
status bit DELETE STATUS is set to true. The value of DELETE STATUS can be
queried with GetShaderiv (see section 6.1.14). DeleteShader will silently ignore
the value zero.
2.15.2 Program Objects
The shader objects that are to be used by the programmable stages of the GL are
collected together to form a program object. The programs that are executed by
these programmable stages are called executables. All information necessary for
de?ning an executable is encapsulated in a program object. A program object is
created with the command
uint CreateProgram(void );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 74
Program objects are empty when they are created. A non-zero name that can be
used to reference the program object is returned. If an error occurs, 0 will be
returned.
To attach a shader object to a program object, use the command
void AttachShader(uint program,uint shader );
The errorINVALID OPERATION is generated if shader is already attached to pro-
gram.
Shader objects may be attached to program objects before source code has
been loaded into the shader object, or before the shader object has been compiled.
Multiple shader objects of the same type may be attached to a single program
object, and a single shader object may be attached to more than one program object.
To detach a shader object from a program object, use the command
void DetachShader(uint program,uint shader );
The errorINVALID OPERATION is generated if shader is not attached to program.
If shader has been ?agged for deletion and is not attached to any other program
object, it is deleted.
In order to use the shader objects contained in a program object, the program
object must be linked. The command
void LinkProgram(uint program );
will link the program object named program. Each program object has a boolean
status, LINK STATUS, that is modi?ed as a result of linking. This status can be
queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.14). This status will be set toTRUE if
a valid executable is created, and FALSE otherwise. Linking can fail for a variety
of reasons as speci?ed in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. Linking
will also fail if one or more of the shader objects, attached to program are not
compiled successfully, or if more active uniform or active sampler variables are
used in program than allowed (see section 2.15.3). If LinkProgram failed, any
information about a previous link of that program object is lost. Thus, a failed link
does not restore the old state of program.
Each program object has an information log that is overwritten as a result of a
link operation. This information log can be queried with GetProgramInfoLog to
obtain more information about the link operation (see section 6.1.14).
If a valid executable is created, it can be made part of the current rendering
state with the command
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 75
void UseProgram(uint program );
This command will install the executable code as part of current rendering state if
the program object program contains valid executable code, i.e. has been linked
successfully. If UseProgram is called with program set to 0, it is as if the GL
had no programmable stages and the ?xed-function paths will be used instead.
If program has not been successfully linked, the error INVALID OPERATION is
generated and the current rendering state is not modi?ed.
While a program object is in use, applications are free to modify attached
shader objects, compile attached shader objects, attach additional shader objects,
and detach shader objects. These operations do not affect the link status or exe-
cutable code of the program object.
If the program object that is in use is re-linked successfully, the LinkProgram
command will install the generated executable code as part of the current rendering
state if the speci?ed program object was already in use as a result of a previous call
to UseProgram.
If that program object that is in use is re-linked unsuccessfully, the link status
will be set to FALSE, but existing executable and associated state will remain part
of the current rendering state until a subsequent call to UseProgram removes it
from use. After such a program is removed from use, it can not be made part of the
current rendering state until it is successfully re-linked.
Program objects can be deleted with the command
void DeleteProgram(uint program );
If program is not the current program for any GL context, it is deleted immediately.
Otherwise, program is ?agged for deletion and will be deleted when it is no longer
the current program for any context. When a program object is deleted, all shader
objects attached to it are detached. DeleteProgram will silently ignore the value
zero.
2.15.3 Shader Variables
A vertex shader can reference a number of variables as it executes. Vertex attributes
are the per-vertex values speci?ed in section 2.7. Uniforms are per-program vari-
ables that are constant during program execution. Samplers are a special form of
uniform used for texturing (section 3.8). Varying variables hold the results of ver-
tex shader execution that are used later in the pipeline. The following sections
describe each of these variable types.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 76
Vertex Attributes
Vertex shaders can access built-in vertex attribute variables corresponding to the
per-vertex state set by commands such as Vertex, Normal, Color. Vertex shaders
can also de?ne named attribute variables, which are bound to the generic vertex
attributes that are set by VertexAttrib*. This binding can be speci?ed by the ap-
plication before the program is linked, or automatically assigned by the GL when
the program is linked.
When an attribute variable declared as afloat,vec2,vec3 orvec4 is bound
to a generic attribute indexi, its value(s) are taken from thex, (x,y), (x,y,z), or
(x,y,z,w) components, respectively, of the generic attributei. When an attribute
variable declared as a mat2, its matrix columns are taken from the (x,y) compo-
nents of generic attributes i and i + 1. When an attribute variable declared as a
mat3, its matrix columns are taken from the (x,y,z) components of generic at-
tributesi throughi+2. When an attribute variable declared as amat4, its matrix
columns are taken from the(x,y,z,w) components of generic attributesi through
i+3.
An attribute variable (either conventional or generic) is considered active if it is
determined by the compiler and linker that the attribute may be accessed when the
shader is executed. Attribute variables that are declared in a vertex shader but never
used will not count against the limit. In cases where the compiler and linker cannot
make a conclusive determination, an attribute will be considered active. A pro-
gram object will fail to link if the sum of the active generic and active conventional
attributes exceedsMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
To determine the set of active vertex attributes used by a program, and to de-
termine their types, use the command:
void GetActiveAttrib(uint program,uint index,
sizei bufSize,sizei *length,int *size,enum *type,
char *name );
This command provides information about the attribute selected by index. An in-
dex of 0 selects the ?rst active attribute, and an index ofACTIVE ATTRIBUTES? 1
selects the last active attribute. The value ofACTIVE ATTRIBUTES can be queried
with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.14). If index is greater than or equal to
ACTIVE ATTRIBUTES, the error INVALID VALUE is generated. Note that index
simply identi?es a member in a list of active attributes, and has no relation to the
generic attribute that the corresponding variable is bound to.
The parameter program is the name of a program object for which the com-
mand LinkProgram has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 77
have been linked successfully. The link could have failed because the number of
active attributes exceeded the limit.
The name of the selected attribute is returned as a null-terminated string in
name. The actual number of characters written into name, excluding the null termi-
nator, is returned in length. If length isNULL, no length is returned. The maximum
number of characters that may be written into name, including the null terminator,
is speci?ed by bufSize. The returned attribute name can be the name of a generic
attribute or a conventional attribute (which begin with the pre?x "gl ", see the
OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation for a complete list). The length of the
longest attribute name in program is given byACTIVE ATTRIBUTE MAX LENGTH,
which can be queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.14).
For the selected attribute, the type of the attribute is returned into type. The
size of the attribute is returned into size. The value in size is in units of the type re-
turned in type. The type returned can be any ofFLOAT,FLOAT VEC2,FLOAT VEC3,
FLOAT VEC4,FLOAT MAT2,FLOAT MAT3, orFLOAT MAT4.
If an error occurred, the return parameters length, size, type and name will be
unmodi?ed.
This command will return as much information about active attributes as pos-
sible. If no information is available, length will be set to zero and name will be an
empty string. This situation could arise if GetActiveAttrib is issued after a failed
link.
After a program object has been linked successfully, the bindings of attribute
variable names to indices can be queried. The command
int GetAttribLocation(uint program,const char *name );
returns the generic attribute index that the attribute variable named name was bound
to when the program object named program was last linked. name must be a null-
terminated string. If name is active and is an attribute matrix, GetAttribLocation
returns the index of the ?rst column of that matrix. If program has not been suc-
cessfully linked, the error INVALID OPERATION is generated. If name is not an
active attribute, if name is a conventional attribute, or if an error occurs, -1 will be
returned.
The binding of an attribute variable to a generic attribute index can also be
speci?ed explicitly. The command
void BindAttribLocation(uint program,uint index,const
char *name );
speci?es that the attribute variable named name in program program should be
bound to generic vertex attribute index when the program is next linked. If name
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 78
was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with index. name must be a
null terminated string. The errorINVALID VALUE is generated if index is equal or
greater than MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS. BindAttribLocation has no effect until the
program is linked. In particular, it doesn’t modify the bindings of active attribute
variables in a program that has already been linked.
Built-in attribute variables are automatically bound to conventional attributes,
and can not have an assigned binding. The error INVALID OPERATION is gener-
ated if name starts with the reserved"gl " pre?x.
When a program is linked, any active attributes without a binding speci?ed
through BindAttribLocation will be automatically be bound to vertex attributes
by the GL. Such bindings can be queried using the command GetAttribLocation.
LinkProgram will fail if the assigned binding of an active attribute variable would
cause the GL to reference a non-existant generic attribute (one greater than or equal
to MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS). LinkProgram will fail if the attribute bindings as-
signed by BindAttribLocation do not leave not enough space to assign a location
for an active matrix attribute, which requires multiple contiguous generic attributes.
LinkProgram will also fail if the vertex shaders used in the program object contain
assignments (not removed during pre-processing) to an attribute variable bound to
generic attribute zero and to the conventional vertex position (gl Vertex).
BindAttribLocation may be issued before any vertex shader objects are at-
tached to a program object. Hence it is allowed to bind any name (except a name
starting with"gl ") to an index, including a name that is never used as an attribute
in any vertex shader object. Assigned bindings for attribute variables that do not
exist or are not active are ignored.
The values of generic attributes sent to generic attribute index i are part of
current state, just like the conventional attributes. If a new program object has
been made active, then these values will be tracked by the GL in such a way that
the same values will be observed by attributes in the new program object that are
also bound to indexi.
It is possible for an application to bind more than one attribute name to the
same location. This is referred to as aliasing. This will only work if only one of
the aliased attributes is active in the executable program, or if no path through the
shader consumes more than one attribute of a set of attributes aliased to the same
location. A link error can occur if the linker determines that every path through the
shader consumes multiple aliased attributes, but implementations are not required
to generate an error in this case. The compiler and linker are allowed to assume that
no aliasing is done, and may employ optimizations that work only in the absence
of aliasing. It is not possible to alias generic attributes with conventional ones.

Uniform Variables
Shaders can declare named uniform variables, as described in the OpenGL Shading
Language Specification. Values for these uniforms are constant over a primitive,
and typically they are constant across many primitives. Uniforms are program
object-speci?c state. They retain their values once loaded, and their values are
restored whenever a program object is used, as long as the program object has not
been re-linked. A uniform is considered active if it is determined by the compiler
and linker that the uniform will actually be accessed when the executable code
is executed. In cases where the compiler and linker cannot make a conclusive
determination, the uniform will be considered active.
The amount of storage available for uniform variables accessed by
a vertex shader is speci?ed by the implementation dependent constant
MAX VERTEX UNIFORM COMPONENTS. This value represents the number of indi-
vidual ?oating-point, integer, or boolean values that can be held in uniform variable
storage for a vertex shader. A link error will be generated if an attempt is made to
utilize more than the space available for vertex shader uniform variables.
When a program is successfully linked, all active uniforms belonging to the
program object are initialized to zero (FALSE for booleans). A successful link will
also generate a location for each active uniform. The values of active uniforms can
be changed using this location and the appropriate Uniform* command (see be-
low). These locations are invalidated and new ones assigned after each successful
re-link.
To ?nd the location of an active uniform variable within a program object, use
the command
int GetUniformLocation(uint program,const
char *name );
This command will return the location of uniform variable name. name must be a
null terminated string, without white space. The value -1 will be returned if name
does not correspond to an active uniform variable name in program or if name starts
with the reserved pre?x"gl ". If program has not been successfully linked, the
error INVALID OPERATION is generated. After a program is linked, the location
of a uniform variable will not change, unless the program is re-linked.
A valid name cannot be a structure, an array of structures, or any portion of
a single vector or a matrix. In order to identify a valid name, the "." (dot) and
"[]" operators can be used in name to specify a member of a structure or element
of an array.
The ?rst element of a uniform array is identi?ed using the name of the uniform
array appended with"[0]". Except if the last part of the string name indicates a
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 80
uniform array, then the location of the ?rst element of that array can be retrieved
by either using the name of the uniform array, or the name of the uniform array
appended with"[0]".
To determine the set of active uniform attributes used by a program, and to
determine their sizes and types, use the command:
void GetActiveUniform(uint program,uint index,
sizei bufSize,sizei *length,int *size,enum *type,
char *name );
This command provides information about the uniform selected by index. An in-
dex of 0 selects the ?rst active uniform, and an index of ACTIVE UNIFORMS? 1
selects the last active uniform. The value of ACTIVE UNIFORMS can be queried
with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.14). If index is greater than or equal to
ACTIVE UNIFORMS, the errorINVALID VALUE is generated. Note that index sim-
ply identi?es a member in a list of active uniforms, and has no relation to the
location assigned to the corresponding uniform variable.
The parameter program is a name of a program object for which the command
LinkProgram has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have
been linked successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active
uniforms exceeded the limit.
If an error occurred, the return parameters length, size, type and name will be
unmodi?ed.
For the selected uniform, the uniform name is returned into name. The string
name will be null terminated. The actual number of characters written into name,
excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length isNULL, no length is
returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into name, in-
cluding the null terminator, is speci?ed by bufSize. The returned uniform name
can be the name of built-in uniform state as well. The complete list of built-
in uniform state is described in section 7.5 of the OpenGL Shading Language
speci?cation. The length of the longest uniform name in program is given by
ACTIVE UNIFORM MAX LENGTH, which can be queried with GetProgramiv (see
section 6.1.14).
Each uniform variable, declared in a shader, is broken down into one or more
strings using the "." (dot) and "[]" operators, if necessary, to the point that it
is legal to pass each string back into GetUniformLocation. Each of these strings
constitutes one active uniform, and each string is assigned an index.
For the selected uniform, the type of the uniform is returned into type.
The size of the uniform is returned into size. The value in size is in units
of the type returned in type. The type returned can be any of FLOAT,
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 81
FLOAT VEC2,FLOAT VEC3,FLOAT VEC4,INT,INT VEC2,INT VEC3,INT VEC4,
BOOL, BOOL VEC2, BOOL VEC3, BOOL VEC4, FLOAT MAT2, FLOAT MAT3,
FLOAT MAT4, SAMPLER 1D, SAMPLER 2D, SAMPLER 3D, SAMPLER CUBE,
SAMPLER 1D SHADOW, orSAMPLER 2D SHADOW.
If one or more elements of an array are active, GetActiveUniform will return
the name of the array in name, subject to the restrictions listed above. The type of
the array is returned in type. The size parameter contains the highest array element
index used, plus one. The compiler or linker determines the highest index used.
There will be only one active uniform reported by the GL per uniform array.
GetActiveUniform will return as much information about active uniforms as
possible. If no information is available, length will be set to zero and name will be
an empty string. This situation could arise if GetActiveUniform is issued after a
failed link.
To load values into the uniform variables of the program object that is currently
in use, use the commands
void Uniform{1234}{if}(int location,T value );
void Uniform{1234}{if}v(int location,sizei count,
T value );
void UniformMatrix{234}{f}v(int location,sizei count,
boolean transpose,const float *value );
The given values are loaded into the uniform variable location identi?ed by loca-
tion.
The Uniform*f{v} commands will load count sets of one to four ?oating-point
values into a uniform location de?ned as a ?oat, a ?oating-point vector, an array of
?oats, or an array of ?oating-point vectors.
The Uniform*i{v} commands will load count sets of one to four integer val-
ues into a uniform location de?ned as a sampler, an integer, an integer vector, an
array of samplers, an array of integers, or an array of integer vectors. Only the
Uniform1i{v} commands can be used to load sampler values (see below).
The UniformMatrix{234}fv commands will load count2? 2,3? 3, or4? 4
matrices (corresponding to 2, 3, or 4 in the command name) of ?oating-point values
into a uniform location de?ned as a matrix or an array of matrices. If transpose
is FALSE, the matrix is speci?ed in column major order, otherwise in row major
order.
When loading values for a uniform declared as a boolean, a boolean vector,
an array of booleans, or an array of boolean vectors, both the Uniform*i{v} and
Uniform*f{v} set of commands can be used to load boolean values. Type con-
version is done by the GL. The uniform is set to FALSE if the input value is 0 or
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 82
0.0f, and set to TRUE otherwise. The Uniform* command used must match the
size of the uniform, as declared in the shader. For example, to load a uniform
declared as a bvec2, either Uniform2i{v} or Uniform2f{v} can be used. An
INVALID OPERATION error will be generated if an attempt is made to use a non-
matching Uniform* command. In this example using Uniform1iv would generate
an error.
For all other uniform types the Uniform* command used must match the size
and type of the uniform, as declared in the shader. No type conversions are done.
For example, to load a uniform declared as a vec4, Uniform4f{v} must be used.
To load a 3x3 matrix, UniformMatrix3fv must be used. AnINVALID OPERATION
error will be generated if an attempt is made to use a non-matching Uniform*
command. In this example, using Uniform4i{v} would generate an error.
When loading N elements starting at an arbitrary position k in a uniform de-
clared as an array, elements k through k + N? 1 in the array will be replaced
with the new values. Values for any array element that exceeds the highest array
element index used, as reported by GetActiveUniform, will be ignored by the GL.
If the value of location is -1, the Uniform* commands will silently ignore the
data passed in, and the current uniform values will not be changed.
If any of the following conditions occur, anINVALID OPERATION error is gen-
erated by the Uniform* commands, and no uniform values are changed:
• if the size indicated in the name of the Uniform* command used does not
match the size of the uniform declared in the shader,
• if the uniform declared in the shader is not of type boolean and the type
indicated in the name of the Uniform* command used does not match the
type of the uniform,
• if count is greater than one, and the uniform declared in the shader is not an
array variable,
• if no variable with a location of location exists in the program object cur-
rently in use and location is not -1, or
• if there is no program object currently in use.
Samplers
Samplers are special uniforms used in the OpenGL Shading Language to identify
the texture object used for each texture lookup. The value of a sampler indicates
the texture image unit being accessed. Setting a sampler’s value toi selects texture
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 83
image unit number i. The values of i range from zero to the implementation-
dependent maximum supported number of texture image units.
The type of the sampler identi?es the target on the texture image unit. The
texture object bound to that texture image unit’s target is then used for the texture
lookup. For example, a variable of typesampler2D selects targetTEXTURE 2D on
its texture image unit. Binding of texture objects to targets is done as usual with
BindTexture. Selecting the texture image unit to bind to is done as usual with
ActiveTexture.
The location of a sampler needs to be queried with GetUniformLocation, just
like any uniform variable. Sampler values need to be set by calling Uniform1i{v}.
Loading samplers with any of the other Uniform* entry points is not allowed and
will result in anINVALID OPERATION error.
It is not allowed to have variables of different sampler types pointing to the
same texture image unit within a program object. This situation can only be de-
tected at the next rendering command issued, and an INVALID OPERATION error
will then be generated.
Active samplers are samplers actually being used in a program object. The
LinkProgram command determines if a sampler is active or not. The LinkPro-
gram command will attempt to determine if the active samplers in the shader(s)
contained in the program object exceed the maximum allowable limits. If it de-
termines that the count of active samplers exceeds the allowable limits, then the
link fails (these limits can be different for different types of shaders). Each active
sampler variable counts against the limit, even if multiple samplers refer to the
same texture image unit. If this cannot be determined at link time, for example if
the program object only contains a vertex shader, then it will be determined at the
next rendering command issued, and an INVALID OPERATION error will then be
generated.
Varying Variables
A vertex shader may de?ne one or more varying variables (see the OpenGL Shad-
ing Language speci?cation). These values are expected to be interpolated across
the primitive being rendered. The OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation de?nes
a set of built-in varying variables for vertex shaders that correspond to the values
required for the ?xed-function processing that occurs after vertex processing.
The number of interpolators available for processing varying variables is given
by the implementation-dependent constantMAX VARYING FLOATS. This value rep-
resents the number of individual ?oating-point values that can be interpolated;
varying variables declared as vectors, matrices, and arrays will all consume multi-
ple interpolators. When a program is linked, all components of any varying vari-
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 84
able written by a vertex shader, or read by a fragment shader, will count against
this limit. The transformed vertex position (gl Position) is not a varying vari-
able and does not count against this limit. A program whose shaders access more
than MAX VARYING FLOATS components worth of varying variables may fail to
link, unless device-dependent optimizations are able to make the program ?t within
available hardware resources.
2.15.4 Shader Execution
If a successfully linked program object that contains a vertex shader is made current
by calling UseProgram, the executable version of the vertex shader is used to
process incoming vertex values rather than the ?xed-function vertex processing
described in sections 2.11 through 2.14. In particular,
• The model-view and projection matrices are not applied to vertex coordi-
nates (section 2.11).
• The texture matrices are not applied to texture coordinates (section 2.11.2).
• Normals are not transformed to eye coordinates, and are not rescaled or nor-
malized (section 2.11.3).
• Normalization of AUTO NORMAL evaluated normals is not performed. (sec-
tion 5.1).
• Texture coordinates are not generated automatically (section 2.11.4).
• Per vertex lighting is not performed (section 2.14.1).
• Color material computations are not performed (section 2.14.3).
• Color index lighting is not performed (section 2.14.5).
• All of the above applies when setting the current raster position (sec-
tion 2.13).
The following operations are applied to vertex values that are the result of
executing the vertex shader:
• Color clamping or masking (section 2.14.6).
• Perspective division on clip coordinates (section 2.11).
• Viewport mapping, including depth range scaling (section 2.11.1).
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 85
• Clipping, including client-de?ned clip planes (section 2.12).
• Front face determination (section 2.14.1).
• Flat-shading (section 2.14.7).
• Color, texture coordinate, fog, point-size and generic attribute clipping (sec-
tion 2.14.8).
• Final color processing (section 2.14.9.
There are several special considerations for vertex shader execution described
in the following sections.
Texture Access
Vertex shaders have the ability to do a lookup into a texture map, if sup-
ported by the GL implementation. The maximum number of texture image
units available to a vertex shader is MAX VERTEX TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS; a
maximum number of zero indicates that the GL implemenation does not sup-
port texture accesses in vertex shaders. The maximum number of texture image
units available to the fragment stage of the GL is MAX TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS.
Both the vertex shader and fragment processing combined cannot use more
than MAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS texture image units. If both
the vertex shader and the fragment processing stage access the same texture
image unit, then that counts as using two texture image units against the
MAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS limit.
When a texture lookup is performed in a vertex shader, the ?ltered texture value
? is computed in the manner described in sections 3.8.8 and 3.8.9, and converted
it to a texture source color C according to table 3.21 (section 3.8.13). A four-
s
component vector(R ,G ,B ,A ) is returned to the vertex shader.
s s s s
In a vertex shader, it is not possible to perform automatic level-of-detail calcu-
lations using partial derivatives of the texture coordinates with respect to window
coordinates as described in section 3.8.8. Hence, there is no automatic selection of
an image array level. Minification or magni?cation of a texture map is controlled
by a level-of-detail value optionally passed as an argument in the texture lookup
functions. If the texture lookup function supplies an explicit level-of-detail valuel,
then the pre-bias level-of-detail value? (x,y) =l (replacing equation 3.18). If
base
the texture lookup function does not supply an explicit level-of-detail value, then
? (x,y) = 0. The scale factor ? (x,y) and its approximation function f(x,y)
base
(see equation 3.21) are ignored.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 86
Texture lookups involving textures with depth component data can either re-
turn the depth data directly or return the results of a comparison with the r tex-
ture coordinate used to perform the lookup, as described in section 3.8.14. The
comparison operation is requested in the shader by using the shadow sampler
types (sampler1DShadow or sampler2DShadow) and in the texture using the
TEXTURE COMPARE MODE parameter. These requests must be consistent; the re-
sults of a texture lookup are unde?ned if:
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of type sampler1D or
sampler2D, and the texture object’s internal format isDEPTH COMPONENT,
and theTEXTURE COMPARE MODE is notNONE.
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of typesampler1DShadow
or sampler2DShadow, and the texture object’s internal format is
DEPTH COMPONENT, and theTEXTURE COMPARE MODE isNONE.
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of typesampler1DShadow
or sampler2DShadow, and the texture object’s internal format is not
DEPTH COMPONENT.
If a vertex shader uses a sampler where the associated texture object is not com-
plete, as de?ned in section 3.8.10, the texture image unit will return (R,G,B,A)
=(0,0,0,1).
Position Invariance
If a vertex shader uses the built-in functionftransform to generate a vertex posi-
tion, then this generally guarantees that the transformed position will be the same
whether using this vertex shader or the ?xed-function pipeline. This allows for cor-
rect multi-pass rendering algorithms, where some passes use ?xed-function vertex
transformation and other passes use a vertex shader. If a vertex shader does not
useftransform to generate a position, transformed positions are not guaranteed
to match, even if the sequence of instructions used to compute the position match
the sequence of transformations described in section 2.11.
Validation
It is not always possible to determine at link time if a program object actually
will execute. Therefore validation is done when the ?rst rendering command is
issued, to determine if the currently active program object can be executed. If
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 87
it cannot be executed then no fragments will be rendered, and Begin, Raster-
Pos, or any command that performs an implicit Begin will generate the error
INVALID OPERATION.
This error is generated by Begin, RasterPos, or any command that performs
an implicit Begin if:
• any two active samplers in the current program object are of different types,
but refer to the same texture image unit,
• any active sampler in the current program object refers to a texture image
unit where ?xed-function fragment processing accesses a texture target that
does not match the sampler type, or
• the sum of the number of active samplers in the program and the number of
texture image units enabled for ?xed-function fragment processing exceeds
the combined limit on the total number of texture image units allowed.
Fixed-function fragment processing operations will be performed if the pro-
gram object in use has no fragment shader.
The INVALID OPERATION error reported by these rendering commands may
not provide enough information to ?nd out why the currently active program object
would not execute. No information at all is available about a program object that
would still execute, but is inef?cient or suboptimal given the current GL state. As
a development aid, use the command
void ValidateProgram(uint program );
to validate the program object program against the current GL state. Each program
object has a boolean status, VALIDATE STATUS, that is modi?ed as a result of
validation. This status can be queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.14).
If validation succeeded this status will be set to TRUE, otherwise it will be set to
FALSE. If validation succeeded the program object is guaranteed to execute, given
the current GL state. If validation failed, the program object is guaranteed to not
execute, given the current GL state.
ValidateProgram will check for all the conditions that could lead to an
INVALID OPERATION error when rendering commands are issued, and may check
for other conditions as well. For example, it could give a hint on how to optimize
some piece of shader code. The information log of program is overwritten with
information on the results of the validation, which could be an empty string. The
results written to the information log are typically only useful during application
development; an application should not expect different GL implementations to
produce identical information.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 88
A shader should not fail to compile, and a program object should not fail to
link due to lack of instruction space or lack of temporary variables. Implementa-
tions should ensure that all valid shaders and program objects may be successfully
compiled, linked and executed.
Unde?ned Behavior
When using array or matrix variables in a shader, it is possible to access a vari-
able with an index computed at run time that is outside the declared extent of the
variable. Such out-of-bounds reads will return unde?ned values; out-of-bounds
writes will have unde?ned results and could corrupt other variables used by shader
or the GL. The level of protection provided against such errors in the shader is
implementation-dependent.
2.15.5 Required State
The GL maintains state to indicate which shader and program object names are in
use. Initially, no shader or program objects exist, and no names are in use.
The state required per shader object consists of:
• An unsigned integer specifying the shader object name.
• An integer holding the value ofSHADER TYPE.
• A boolean holding the delete status, initiallyFALSE.
• A boolean holding the status of the last compile, initiallyFALSE.
• An array of typechar containing the information log, initially empty.
• An integer holding the length of the information log.
• An array of type char containing the concatenated shader string, initially
empty.
• An integer holding the length of the concatenated shader string.
The state required per program object consists of:
• An unsigned integer indicating the program object object name.
• A boolean holding the delete status, initiallyFALSE.
• A boolean holding the status of the last link attempt, initiallyFALSE.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20042.15. VERTEXSHADERS 89
• A boolean holding the status of the last validation attempt, initallyFALSE.
• An integer holding the number of attached shader objects.
• A list of unsigned integers to keep track of the names of the shader objects
attached.
• An array of typechar containing the information log, initially empty.
• An integer holding the length of the information log.
• An integer holding the number of active uniforms.
• For each active uniform, three integers, holding its location, size, and type,
and an array of typechar holding its name.
• An array of words that hold the values of each active uniform.
• An integer holding the number of active attributes.
• For each active attbribute, three integers holding its location, size, and type,
and an array of typechar holding its name.
Additional state required to support vertex shaders consists of:
• A bit indicating whether or not vertex program two-sided color mode is en-
abled, initially disabled.
• A bit indicating whether or not vertex program point size mode (sec-
tion 3.3.1) is enabled, initially disabled.
Additionally, one unsigned integer is required to hold the name of the current pro-
gram object, if any.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Chapter 3
Rasterization
Rasterization is the process by which a primitive is converted to a two-dimensional
image. Each point of this image contains such information as color and depth.
Thus, rasterizing a primitive consists of two parts. The ?rst is to determine which
squares of an integer grid in window coordinates are occupied by the primitive. The
second is assigning a depth value and one or more color values to each such square.
The results of this process are passed on to the next stage of the GL (per-fragment
operations), which uses the information to update the appropriate locations in the
framebuffer. Figure 3.1 diagrams the rasterization process. The color values
assigned to a fragment are initially determined by the rasterization operations (sec-
tions 3.3 through 3.7) and modi?ed by either the execution of the texturing, color
sum, and fog operations de?ned in sections 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10, or by a fragment
shader as de?ned in section 3.11. The ?nal depth value is initially determined by
the rasterization operations and may be modi?ed or replaced by a fragment shader.
The results from rasterizing a point, line, polygon, pixel rectangle or bitmap can be
routed through a fragment shader.
A grid square along with its parameters of assigned colors,z (depth), fog coor-
dinate, and texture coordinates is called a fragment; the parameters are collectively
dubbed the fragment’s associated data. A fragment is located by its lower left cor-
ner, which lies on integer grid coordinates. Rasterization operations also refer to a
fragment’s center, which is offset by (1/2,1/2) from its lower left corner (and so
lies on half-integer coordinates).
Grid squares need not actually be square in the GL. Rasterization rules are not
affected by the actual aspect ratio of the grid squares. Display of non-square grids,
however, will cause rasterized points and line segments to appear fatter in one
direction than the other. We assume that fragments are square, since it simpli?es
antialiasing and texturing.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.1. INVARIANCE 92
Several factors affect rasterization. Lines and polygons may be stippled. Points
may be given differing diameters and line segments differing widths. A point, line
segment, or polygon may be antialiased.
3.1 Invariance
0
Consider a primitivep obtained by translating a primitivep through an offset(x,y)
0
in window coordinates, wherex andy are integers. As long as neitherp norp is
0 0
clipped, it must be the case that each fragmentf produced fromp is identical to
0
a corresponding fragment f from p except that the center of f is offset by (x,y)
from the center off.
3.2 Antialiasing
Antialiasing of a point, line, or polygon is effected in one of two ways depending
on whether the GL is in RGBA or color index mode.
In RGBA mode, the R, G, and B values of the rasterized fragment are left
unaffected, but the A value is multiplied by a ?oating-point value in the range
[0,1] that describes a fragment’s screen pixel coverage. The per-fragment stage of
the GL can be set up to use the A value to blend the incoming fragment with the
corresponding pixel already present in the framebuffer.
In color index mode, the least signi?cantb bits (to the left of the binary point)
of the color index are used for antialiasing;b = min{4,m}, wherem is the number
of bits in the color index portion of the framebuffer. The antialiasing process sets
theseb bits based on the fragment’s coverage value: the bits are set to zero for no
coverage and to all ones for complete coverage.
The details of how antialiased fragment coverage values are computed are dif-
?cult to specify in general. The reason is that high-quality antialiasing may take
into account perceptual issues as well as characteristics of the monitor on which
the contents of the framebuffer are displayed. Such details cannot be addressed
within the scope of this document. Further, the coverage value computed for a
fragment of some primitive may depend on the primitive’s relationship to a num-
ber of grid squares neighboring the one corresponding to the fragment, and not just
on the fragment’s grid square. Another consideration is that accurate calculation
of coverage values may be computationally expensive; consequently we allow a
given GL implementation to approximate true coverage values by using a fast but
not entirely accurate coverage computation.
In light of these considerations, we chose to specify the behavior of exact an-
tialiasing in the prototypical case that each displayed pixel is a perfect square of
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.2. ANTIALIASING 93
uniform intensity. The square is called a fragment square and has lower left corner
(x,y) and upper right corner(x+1,y+1). We recognize that this simple box ?lter
may not produce the most favorable antialiasing results, but it provides a simple,
well-de?ned model.
A GL implementation may use other methods to perform antialiasing, subject
to the following conditions:
1. Iff andf are two fragments, and the portion off covered by some prim-
1 2 1

2. The coverage computation for a fragment f must be local: it may depend
only onf’s relationship to the boundary of the primitive being rasterized. It
may not depend onf’sx andy coordinates.
Another property that is desirable, but not required, is:
3. The sum of the coverage values for all fragments produced by rasterizing a
particular primitive must be constant, independent of any rigid motions in
window coordinates, as long as none of those fragments lies along window
edges.
In some implementations, varying degrees of antialiasing quality may be obtained
by providing GL hints (section 5.6), allowing a user to make an image quality
versus speed tradeoff.
3.2.1 Multisampling
Multisampling is a mechanism to antialias all GL primitives: points, lines, poly-
gons, bitmaps, and images. The technique is to sample all primitives multiple times
at each pixel. The color sample values are resolved to a single, displayable color
each time a pixel is updated, so the antialiasing appears to be automatic at the
application level. Because each sample includes color, depth, and stencil informa-
tion, the color (including texture operation), depth, and stencil functions perform
equivalently to the single-sample mode.
An additional buffer, called the multisample buffer, is added to the framebuffer.
Pixel sample values, including color, depth, and stencil values, are stored in this
buffer. Samples contain separate color values for each fragment color. When
the framebuffer includes a multisample buffer, it does not include depth or stencil
buffers, even if the multisample buffer does not store depth or stencil values. Color
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.2. ANTIALIASING 94
buffers (left, right, front, back, and aux) do coexist with the multisample buffer,
however.
Multisample antialiasing is most valuable for rendering polygons, because it
requires no sorting for hidden surface elimination, and it correctly handles adjacent
polygons, object silhouettes, and even intersecting polygons. If only points or
lines are being rendered, the “smooth” antialiasing mechanism provided by the
base GL may result in a higher quality image. This mechanism is designed to
allow multisample and smooth antialiasing techniques to be alternated during the
rendering of a single scene.
If the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is one, the rasterization of all primi-
tives is changed, and is referred to as multisample rasterization. Otherwise,
primitive rasterization is referred to as single-sample rasterization. The value
of SAMPLE BUFFERS is queried by calling GetIntegerv with pname set to
SAMPLE BUFFERS.
During multisample rendering the contents of a pixel fragment are changed
in two ways. First, each fragment includes a coverage value with SAMPLES bits.
The value ofSAMPLES is an implementation-dependent constant, and is queried by
calling GetIntegerv with pname set toSAMPLES.
Second, each fragment includesSAMPLES depth values, color values, and sets
of texture coordinates, instead of the single depth value, color value, and set of
texture coordinates that is maintained in single-sample rendering mode. An imple-
mentation may choose to assign the same color value and the same set of texture
coordinates to more than one sample. The location for evaluating the color value
and the set of texture coordinates can be anywhere within the pixel including the
fragment center or any of the sample locations. The color value and the set of tex-
ture coordinates need not be evaluated at the same location. Each pixel fragment
thus consists of integer x and y grid coordinates,SAMPLES color and depth values,
SAMPLES sets of texture coordinates, and a coverage value with a maximum of
SAMPLES bits.
Multisample rasterization is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable
with the symbolic constantMULTISAMPLE.
If MULTISAMPLE is disabled, multisample rasterization of all primitives is
equivalent to single-sample (fragment-center) rasterization, except that the frag-
ment coverage value is set to full coverage. The color and depth values and the
sets of texture coordinates may all be set to the values that would have been as-
signed by single-sample rasterization, or they may be assigned as described below
for multisample rasterization.
IfMULTISAMPLE is enabled, multisample rasterization of all primitives differs
substantially from single-sample rasterization. It is understood that each pixel in
the framebuffer has SAMPLES locations associated with it. These locations are
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.3. POINTS 95
exact positions, rather than regions or areas, and each is referred to as a sample
point. The sample points associated with a pixel may be located inside or outside
of the unit square that is considered to bound the pixel. Furthermore, the relative
locations of sample points may be identical for each pixel in the framebuffer, or
they may differ.
If the sample locations differ per pixel, they should be aligned to window, not
screen, boundaries. Otherwise rendering results will be window-position speci?c.
The invariance requirement described in section 3.1 is relaxed for all multisample
rasterization, because the sample locations may be a function of pixel location.
It is not possible to query the actual sample locations of a pixel.
3.3 Points
If a vertex shader is not active, then the rasterization of points is controlled with
void PointSize(float size );
size speci?es the requested size of a point. The default value is 1.0. A value less
than or equal to zero results in the errorINVALID VALUE.
The requested point size is multiplied with a distance attenuation factor,
clamped to a speci?ed point size range, and further clamped to the implementation-
dependent point size range to produce the derived point size:
s
 !
 

derived size =clamp size?
2
a+b? d+c? d
whered is the eye-coordinate distance from the eye,(0,0,0,1) in eye coordinates,
to the vertex, anda,b, andc are distance attenuation function coef?cients.
If multisampling is not enabled, the derived size is passed on to rasterization as
the point width.
If a vertex shader is active and vertex program point size mode is enabled,
then the derived point size is taken from the (potentially clipped) shader builtin
gl PointSize and clamped to the implementation-dependent point size range. If
the value written togl PointSize is less than or equal to zero, results are unde-
?ned. If a vertex shader is active and vertex program point size mode is disabled,
then the derived point size is taken from the point size state as speci?ed by the
PointSize command. In this case no distance attenuation is performed. Vertex pro-
gram point size mode is enabled and disabled by calling Enable or Disable with
the symbolic valueVERTEX PROGRAM POINT SIZE.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.3. POINTS 96
If multisampling is enabled, an implementation may optionally fade the point
alpha (see section 3.13) instead of allowing the point width to go below a given
threshold. In this case, the width of the rasterized point is
(

and the fade factor is computed as follows:

The distance attenuation function coef?cientsa,b, andc, the bounds of the ?rst
point size range clamp, and the point fadethreshold, are speci?ed with
void PointParameter{if}(enum pname,T param );
void PointParameter{if}v(enum pname,const T params );
If pname is POINT SIZE MIN or POINT SIZE MAX, then param speci-
?es, or params points to the lower or upper bound respectively to which
the derived point size is clamped. If the lower bound is greater than
the upper bound, the point size after clamping is unde?ned. If pname is
POINT DISTANCE ATTENUATION, then params points to the coef?cients a, b,
and c. If pname is POINT FADE THRESHOLD SIZE, then param speci?es,
or params points to the point fade threshold. Values of POINT SIZE MIN,
POINT SIZE MAX, or POINT FADE THRESHOLD SIZE less than zero result in the
errorINVALID VALUE.
Point antialiasing is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the
symbolic constantPOINT SMOOTH. The default state is for point antialiasing to be
disabled.
Point sprites are enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the
symbolic constant POINT SPRITE. The default state is for point sprites to be dis-
abled. When point sprites are enabled, the state of the point antialiasing enable is
ignored.
The point sprite texture coordinate replacement mode is set with one of the
TexEnv* commands described in section 3.8.13, where target is POINT SPRITE
and pname is COORD REPLACE. The possible values for param are FALSE and
TRUE. The default value for each texture coordinate set is for point sprite texture
coordinate replacement to be disabled.
The point sprite texture coordinate origin is set with the PointParame-
ter* commands where pname is POINT SPRITE COORD ORIGIN and param is
LOWER LEFT orUPPER LEFT. The default value isUPPER LEFT.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.3. POINTS 97
3.3.1 Basic Point Rasterization
In the default state, a point is rasterized by truncating its x and y coordinates
w w
(recall that the subscripts indicate that these are x and y window coordinates) to
integers. This (x,y) address, along with data derived from the data associated
with the vertex corresponding to the point, is sent as a single fragment to the per-
fragment stage of the GL.
The effect of a point width other than1.0 depends on the state of point antialias-
ing and point sprites. If antialiasing and point sprites are disabled, the actual width
is determined by rounding the supplied width to the nearest integer, then clamp-
ing it to the implementation-dependent maximum non-antialiased point width.
This implementation-dependent value must be no less than the implementation-
dependent maximum antialiased point width, rounded to the nearest integer value,
and in any event no less than1. If rounding the speci?ed width results in the value
0, then it is as if the value were1. If the resulting width is odd, then the point
1 1

w w

is computed from the vertex’sx andy , and a square grid of the odd width cen-
w w
tered at (x,y) de?nes the centers of the rasterized fragments (recall that fragment
centers lie at half-integer window coordinate values). If the width is even, then the
center point is

the rasterized fragment centers are the half-integer window coordinate values
within the square of the even width centered on(x,y). See ?gure 3.2.

Figure 3.3. Rasterization of antialiased wide points. The black dot indicates the
point to be rasterized. The shaded region has the speci?ed width. The X marks
indicate those fragment centers produced by rasterization. A fragment’s computed
coverage value is based on the portion of the shaded region that covers the corre-
sponding fragment square. Solid lines lie on integer coordinates.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.3. POINTS 100
All fragments produced in rasterizing a non-antialiased point are assigned the
same associated data, which are those of the vertex corresponding to the point.
If antialiasing is enabled and point sprites are disabled, then point rasterization
produces a fragment for each fragment square that intersects the region lying within
the circle having diameter equal to the current point width and centered at the
point’s(x ,y ) (?gure 3.3). The coverage value for each fragment is the window
w w
coordinate area of the intersection of the circular region with the corresponding
fragment square (but see section 3.2). This value is saved and used in the ?nal
step of rasterization (section 3.12). The data associated with each fragment are
otherwise the data associated with the point being rasterized.
Not all widths need be supported when point antialiasing is on, but the width
1.0 must be provided. If an unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported
width is used instead. The range of supported widths and the width of evenly-
spaced gradations within that range are implementation dependent. The range and
gradations may be obtained using the query mechanism described in chapter 6. If,
for instance, the width range is from 0.1 to 2.0 and the gradation width is 0.1, then
the widths0.1,0.2,...,1.9,2.0 are supported.
If point sprites are enabled, then point rasterization produces a fragment for
each framebuffer pixel whose center lies inside a square centered at the point’s
(x ,y ), with side length equal to the current point size.
w w
All fragments produced in rasterizing a point sprite are assigned the same as-
sociated data, which are those of the vertex corresponding to the point. How-
ever, for each texture coordinate set where COORD REPLACE is TRUE, these
texture coordinates are replaced with point sprite texture coordinates. The s
coordinate varies from 0 to 1 across the point horizontally left-to-right. If
POINT SPRITE COORD ORIGIN is LOWER LEFT, the t coordinate varies from 0
to 1 vertically bottom-to-top. Otherwise if the point sprite texture coordinate ori-
gin is UPPER LEFT, the t coordinate varies from 0 to 1 vertically top-to-bottom.
Ther andq coordinates are replaced with the constants 0 and 1, respectively.

the fragment, andx andy are the exact, unrounded window coordinates of the
w w
vertex for the point.
The widths supported for point sprites must be a superset of those supported
for antialiased points. There is no requirement that these widths must be equally
spaced. If an unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported width is used
instead.
3.3.2 Point Rasterization State
The state required to control point rasterization consists of the ?oating-point point
width, three ?oating-point values specifying the minimum and maximum point size
and the point fade threshold size, three ?oating-point values specifying the distance
attenuation coef?cients, a bit indicating whether or not antialiasing is enabled, a
bit for the point sprite texture coordinate replacement mode for each texture coor-
dinate set, and a bit for the point sprite texture coordinate origin.
3.3.3 Point Multisample Rasterization
IfMULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is one, then points
are rasterized using the following algorithm, regardless of whether point antialias-
ing (POINT SMOOTH) is enabled or disabled. Point rasterization produces a frag-
ment for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that intersect
a region centered at the point’s (x ,y ). This region is a circle having diameter
w w
equal to the current point width if POINT SPRITE is disabled, or a square with
side equal to the current point width if POINT SPRITE is enabled. Coverage bits
that correspond to sample points that intersect the region are 1, other coverage bits
are 0. All data associated with each sample for the fragment are the data associ-
ated with the point being rasterized, with the exception of texture coordinates when
POINT SPRITE is enabled; these texture coordinates are computed as described in
section 3.3.
Point size range and number of gradations are equivalent to those supported
for antialiased points when POINT SPRITE is disabled. The set of point sizes
supported is equivalent to those for point sprites without multisample when
POINT SPRITE is enabled.
3.4 Line Segments
A line segment results from a line strip Begin/End object, a line loop, or a se-
ries of separate line segments. Line segment rasterization is controlled by several
variables. Line width, which may be set by calling
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.4. LINESEGMENTS 102
void LineWidth(float width );
with an appropriate positive ?oating-point width, controls the width of rasterized
line segments. The default width is 1.0. Values less than or equal to 0.0 generate
the error INVALID VALUE. Antialiasing is controlled with Enable and Disable
using the symbolic constantLINE SMOOTH. Finally, line segments may be stippled.
Stippling is controlled by a GL command that sets a stipple pattern (see below).
3.4.1 Basic Line Segment Rasterization
Line segment rasterization begins by characterizing the segment as either x-major
or y-major. x-major line segments have slope in the closed interval [? 1,1]; all
other line segments arey-major (slope is determined by the segment’s endpoints).
We shall specify rasterization only forx-major segments except in cases where the
modi?cations fory-major segments are not self-evident.
Ideally, the GL uses a “diamond-exit” rule to determine those fragments that
are produced by rasterizing a line segment. For each fragmentf with center at win-
dow coordinatesx andy , de?ne a diamond-shaped region that is the intersection
f f
of four half planes:
R ={(x,y)||x? x|+|y? y|< 1/2.}
f f f
Essentially, a line segment starting atp and ending atp produces those frag-
a b
mentsf for which the segment intersectsR , except ifp is contained inR . See
f b f
?gure 3.4.
To avoid dif?culties when an endpoint lies on a boundary ofR we (in princi-
f
ple) perturb the supplied endpoints by a tiny amount. Letp andp have window
a b
0
coordinates (x ,y ) and (x ,y ), respectively. Obtain the perturbed endpointsp
a a b b
a

given by (x ,y )? (, ) andp given by (x ,y )? (, ). Rasterizing the line

b
segment starting atp and ending atp produces those fragmentsf for which the

segment starting atp and ending onp intersectsR , except ifp is contained in
f
a
b b
R .  is chosen to be so small that rasterizing the line segment produces the same
f
fragments when? is substituted for for any0<? ? .
When p and p lie on fragment centers, this characterization of fragments
a b
reduces to Bresenham’s algorithm with one modi?cation: lines produced in this
description are “half-open,” meaning that the ?nal fragment (corresponding top )
b
is not drawn. This means that when rasterizing a series of connected line segments,
shared endpoints will be produced only once rather than twice (as would occur with
Bresenham’s algorithm).
Because the initial and ?nal conditions of the diamond-exit rule may be dif?cult
to implement, other line segment rasterization algorithms are allowed, subject to
the following rules:

Figure 3.4. Visualization of Bresenham’s algorithm. A portion of a line segment is
shown. A diamond shaped region of height 1 is placed around each fragment center;
those regions that the line segment exits cause rasterization to produce correspond-
ing fragments.
1. The coordinates of a fragment produced by the algorithm may not deviate by
more than one unit in eitherx ory window coordinates from a corresponding
fragment produced by the diamond-exit rule.
2. The total number of fragments produced by the algorithm may differ from
that produced by the diamond-exit rule by no more than one.
3. For anx-major line, no two fragments may be produced that lie in the same
window-coordinate column (for a y-major line, no two fragments may ap-
pear in the same row).
4. If two line segments share a common endpoint, and both segments are either
x-major (both left-to-right or both right-to-left) ory-major (both bottom-to-
top or both top-to-bottom), then rasterizing both segments may not produce
duplicate fragments, nor may any fragments be omitted so as to interrupt
continuity of the connected segments.
Next we must specify how the data associated with each rasterized fragment
are obtained. Let the window coordinates of a produced fragment center be given
byp = (x ,y ) and letp = (x ,y ) andp = (x ,y ). Set

or a color index (in color index mode), the fog coordinate, thes,t,r, orq texture

using equation 3.7, below), is found as

and ending endpoints of the segments, respectively. Note that linear interpolation
would use
f = (1? t)f +tf . (3.7)

The reason that this formula is incorrect (except for the depth value) is that it inter-
polates a datum in window space, which may be distorted by perspective. What is
actually desired is to ?nd the corresponding value when interpolated in clip space,
which equation 3.6 does. A GL implementation may choose to approximate equa-
tion 3.6 with 3.7, but this will normally lead to unacceptable distortion effects when
interpolating texture coordinates or clipw coordinates.
3.4.2 Other Line Segment Features
We have just described the rasterization of non-antialiased line segments of width
one using the default line stipple of FFFF . We now describe the rasterization
16
of line segments for general values of the line segment rasterization parameters.
Line Stipple
The command
void LineStipple(int factor,ushort pattern );
de?nes a line stipple. pattern is an unsigned short integer. The line stipple is taken
from the lowest order 16 bits of pattern. It determines those fragments that are
to be drawn when the line is rasterized. factor is a count that is used to modify
the effective line stipple by causing each bit in line stipple to be used factor times.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.4. LINESEGMENTS 105
factor is clamped to the range[1,256]. Line stippling may be enabled or disabled
using Enable or Disable with the constantLINE STIPPLE. When disabled, it is as
if the line stipple has its default value.
Line stippling masks certain fragments that are produced by rasterization so
that they are not sent to the per-fragment stage of the GL. The masking is achieved
using three parameters: the 16-bit line stipple p, the line repeat count r, and an
integer stipple counters. Let
b =bs/rc mod 16,
Then a fragment is produced if the bth bit of p is 1, and not produced otherwise.
The bits of p are numbered with 0 being the least signi?cant and 15 being the
most signi?cant. The initial value of s is zero; s is incremented after production
of each fragment of a line segment (fragments are produced in order, beginning at
the starting point and working towards the ending point). s is reset to 0 whenever
a Begin occurs, and before every line segment in a group of independent segments
(as speci?ed when Begin is invoked withLINES).
If the line segment has been clipped, then the value ofs at the beginning of the
line segment is indeterminate.
Wide Lines
The actual width of non-antialiased lines is determined by rounding the supplied
width to the nearest integer, then clamping it to the implementation-dependent
maximum non-antialiased line width. This implementation-dependent value must
be no less than the implementation-dependent maximum antialiased line width,
rounded to the nearest integer value, and in any event no less than 1. If rounding
the speci?ed width results in the value0, then it is as if the value were1.
Non-antialiased line segments of width other than one are rasterized by off-
setting them in the minor direction (for an x-major line, the minor direction is
y, and for a y-major line, the minor direction is x) and replicating fragments in
the minor direction (see ?gure 3.5). Let w be the width rounded to the nearest
integer (if w = 0, then it is as if w = 1). If the line segment has endpoints
given by (x ,y ) and (x ,y ) in window coordinates, the segment with endpoints
0 0 1 1
(x ,y ? (w? 1)/2) and(x ,y ? (w? 1)/2) is rasterized, but instead of a single
0 0 1 1
fragment, a column of fragments of heightw (a row of fragments of lengthw for
a y-major segment) is produced at each x (y for y-major) location. The lowest
fragment of this column is the fragment that would be produced by rasterizing the
segment of width 1 with the modi?ed coordinates. The whole column is not pro-
duced if the stipple bit for the column’s x location is zero; otherwise, the whole
column is produced.

Figure 3.5. Rasterization of non-antialiased wide lines. x-major line segments are
shown. The heavy line segment is the one speci?ed to be rasterized; the light seg-
ment is the offset segment used for rasterization. x marks indicate the fragment
centers produced by rasterization.
Antialiasing
Rasterized antialiased line segments produce fragments whose fragment squares
intersect a rectangle centered on the line segment. Two of the edges are parallel to
the speci?ed line segment; each is at a distance of one-half the current width from
that segment: one above the segment and one below it. The other two edges pass
through the line endpoints and are perpendicular to the direction of the speci?ed
line segment. Coverage values are computed for each fragment by computing the
area of the intersection of the rectangle with the fragment square (see ?gure 3.6;
see also section 3.2). Equation 3.6 is used to compute associated data values just as
with non-antialiased lines; equation 3.5 is used to ?nd the value oft for each frag-
ment whose square is intersected by the line segment’s rectangle. Not all widths
need be supported for line segment antialiasing, but width1.0 antialiased segments
must be provided. As with the point width, a GL implementation may be queried
for the range and number of gradations of available antialiased line widths.
For purposes of antialiasing, a stippled line is considered to be a sequence of
contiguous rectangles centered on the line segment. Each rectangle has width equal
to the current line width and length equal to 1 pixel (except the last, which may be
shorter). These rectangles are numbered from 0 to n, starting with the rectangle

incident on the starting endpoint of the segment. Each of these rectangles is ei-
ther eliminated or produced according to the procedure given under Line Stipple,
above, where “fragment” is replaced with “rectangle.” Each rectangle so produced
is rasterized as if it were an antialiased polygon, described below (but culling, non-
default settings of PolygonMode, and polygon stippling are not applied).
3.4.3 Line Rasterization State
The state required for line rasterization consists of the ?oating-point line width, a
16-bit line stipple, the line stipple repeat count, a bit indicating whether stippling
is enabled or disabled, and a bit indicating whether line antialiasing is on or off.
In addition, during rasterization, an integer stipple counter must be maintained to
implement line stippling. The initial value of the line width is1.0. The initial value
of the line stipple is FFFF (a stipple of all ones). The initial value of the line
16
stipple repeat count is one. The initial state of line stippling is disabled. The initial
state of line segment antialiasing is disabled.
3.4.4 Line Multisample Rasterization
IfMULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is one, then lines
are rasterized using the following algorithm, regardless of whether line antialiasing
(LINE SMOOTH) is enabled or disabled. Line rasterization produces a fragment for
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 108
each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that intersect the rectangular
region that is described in the Antialiasing portion of section 3.4.2 (Other Line
Segment Features). If line stippling is enabled, the rectangular region is subdivided
into adjacent unit-length rectangles, with some rectangles eliminated according to
the procedure given in section 3.4.2, where “fragment” is replaced by “rectangle”.
Coverage bits that correspond to sample points that intersect a retained rectan-
gle are 1, other coverage bits are 0. Each color, depth, and set of texture coordinates
is produced by substituting the corresponding sample location into equation 3.5,
then using the result to evaluate equation 3.7. An implementation may choose to
assign the same color value and the same set of texture coordinates to more than
one sample by evaluating equation 3.5 at any location within the pixel including
the fragment center or any one of the sample locations, then substituting into equa-
tion 3.6. The color value and the set of texture coordinates need not be evaluated
at the same location.
Line width range and number of gradations are equivalent to those supported
for antialiased lines.
3.5 Polygons
A polygon results from a polygon Begin/End object, a triangle resulting from a
triangle strip, triangle fan, or series of separate triangles, or a quadrilateral arising
from a quadrilateral strip, series of separate quadrilaterals, or a Rect command.
Like points and line segments, polygon rasterization is controlled by several vari-
ables. Polygon antialiasing is controlled with Enable and Disable with the sym-
bolic constant POLYGON SMOOTH. The analog to line segment stippling for poly-
gons is polygon stippling, described below.
3.5.1 Basic Polygon Rasterization
The ?rst step of polygon rasterization is to determine if the polygon is back facing
or front facing. This determination is made by examining the sign of the area com-
puted by equation 2.6 of section 2.14.1 (including the possible reversal of this sign
as indicated by the last call to FrontFace). If this sign is positive, the polygon is
frontfacing; otherwise, it is back facing. This determination is used in conjunction
with the CullFace enable bit and mode value to decide whether or not a particular
polygon is rasterized. The CullFace mode is set by calling
void CullFace(enum mode );
mode is a symbolic constant: one of FRONT, BACK or FRONT AND BACK. Culling
is enabled or disabled with Enable or Disable using the symbolic constant
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 109
CULL FACE. Front facing polygons are rasterized if either culling is disabled or
the CullFace mode is BACK while back facing polygons are rasterized only if ei-
ther culling is disabled or the CullFace mode is FRONT. The initial setting of the
CullFace mode isBACK. Initially, culling is disabled.
The rule for determining which fragments are produced by polygon rasteriza-
tion is called point sampling. The two-dimensional projection obtained by taking
the x and y window coordinates of the polygon’s vertices is formed. Fragment
centers that lie inside of this polygon are produced by rasterization. Special treat-
ment is given to a fragment whose center lies on a polygon boundary edge. In
such a case we require that if two polygons lie on either side of a common edge
(with identical endpoints) on which a fragment center lies, then exactly one of the
polygons results in the production of the fragment during rasterization.
As for the data associated with each fragment produced by rasterizing a poly-
gon, we begin by specifying how these values are produced for fragments in a
triangle. De?ne barycentric coordinates for a triangle. Barycentric coordinates are
a set of three numbers, a, b, and c, each in the range [0,1], with a +b +c = 1.
These coordinates uniquely specify any pointp within the triangle or on the trian-
gle’s boundary as
p =ap +bp +cp ,
a b c
wherep ,p , andp are the vertices of the triangle. a,b, andc can be found as
a b c
A(pp p ) A(pp p ) A(pp p )
b c a c a b
a = , b = , c = ,
A(p p p ) A(p p p ) A(p p p )
a b c a b c a b c
whereA(lmn) denotes the area in window coordinates of the triangle with vertices
l,m, andn.
Denote a datum atp ,p , orp asf ,f , orf , respectively. Then the valuef
a b c a b c
of a datum at a fragment produced by rasterizing a triangle is given by
af /w +bf /w +cf /w
a a c c
b b
f = (3.8)
a/w +b/w +c/w
a b c
where w , w and w are the clip w coordinates of p , p , and p , respectively.
a b c a b c
a, b, and c are the barycentric coordinates of the fragment for which the data are
produced. a, b, and c must correspond precisely to the exact coordinates of the
center of the fragment. Another way of saying this is that the data associated with
a fragment must be sampled at the fragment’s center.
Just as with line segment rasterization, equation 3.8 may be approximated by
f =af +bf +cf ;
a b c
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 110
this may yield acceptable results for color values (it must be used for depth val-
ues), but will normally lead to unacceptable distortion effects if used for texture
coordinates or clipw coordinates.
For a polygon with more than three edges, we require only that a convex com-
bination of the values of the datum at the polygon’s vertices can be used to obtain
the value assigned to each fragment produced by the rasterization algorithm. That
is, it must be the case that at every fragment

fragment to fragment, but at vertexi,a = 0,j6=i anda = 1.
j i
One algorithm that achieves the required behavior is to triangulate a polygon
(without adding any vertices) and then treat each triangle individually as already
discussed. A scan-line rasterizer that linearly interpolates data along each edge
and then linearly interpolates data across each horizontal span from edge to edge
also satis?es the restrictions (in this case, the numerator and denominator of equa-
tion 3.8 should be iterated independently and a division performed for each frag-
ment).
3.5.2 Stippling
Polygon stippling works much the same way as line stippling, masking out certain
fragments produced by rasterization so that they are not sent to the next stage of
the GL. This is the case regardless of the state of polygon antialiasing. Stippling is
controlled with
void PolygonStipple(ubyte *pattern );
pattern is a pointer to memory into which a32? 32 pattern is packed. The pattern
is unpacked from memory according to the procedure given in section 3.6.4 for
DrawPixels; it is as if the height and width passed to that command were both equal
to 32, the type were BITMAP, and the format were COLOR INDEX. The unpacked
values (before any conversion or arithmetic would have been performed) form a
stipple pattern of zeros and ones.
If x and y are the window coordinates of a rasterized polygon fragment,
w w
then that fragment is sent to the next stage of the GL if and only if the bit of the
pattern(x mod 32,y mod 32) is 1.
w w
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 111
Polygon stippling may be enabled or disabled with Enable or Disable using
the constantPOLYGON STIPPLE. When disabled, it is as if the stipple pattern were
all ones.
3.5.3 Antialiasing
Polygon antialiasing rasterizes a polygon by producing a fragment wherever the
interior of the polygon intersects that fragment’s square. A coverage value is com-
puted at each such fragment, and this value is saved to be applied as described
in section 3.12. An associated datum is assigned to a fragment by integrating the
datum’s value over the region of the intersection of the fragment square with the
polygon’s interior and dividing this integrated value by the area of the intersection.
For a fragment square lying entirely within the polygon, the value of a datum at the
fragment’s center may be used instead of integrating the value across the fragment.
Polygon stippling operates in the same way whether polygon antialiasing is
enabled or not. The polygon point sampling rule de?ned in section 3.5.1, however,
is not enforced for antialiased polygons.
3.5.4 Options Controlling Polygon Rasterization
The interpretation of polygons for rasterization is controlled using
void PolygonMode(enum face,enum mode );
face is one of FRONT, BACK, or FRONT AND BACK, indicating that the rasterizing
method described by mode replaces the rasterizing method for front facing poly-
gons, back facing polygons, or both front and back facing polygons, respectively.
mode is one of the symbolic constants POINT, LINE, or FILL. Calling Polygon-
Mode withPOINT causes certain vertices of a polygon to be treated, for rasteriza-
tion purposes, just as if they were enclosed within a Begin(POINT) and End pair.
The vertices selected for this treatment are those that have been tagged as having a
polygon boundary edge beginning on them (see section 2.6.2). LINE causes edges
that are tagged as boundary to be rasterized as line segments. (The line stipple
counter is reset at the beginning of the ?rst rasterized edge of the polygon, but
not for subsequent edges.) FILL is the default mode of polygon rasterization, cor-
responding to the description in sections 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. Note that these
modes affect only the ?nal rasterization of polygons: in particular, a polygon’s ver-
tices are lit, and the polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these modes are
applied.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 112
Polygon antialiasing applies only to the FILL state of PolygonMode. For
POINT or LINE, point antialiasing or line segment antialiasing, respectively, ap-
ply.
3.5.5 Depth Offset
The depth values of all fragments generated by the rasterization of a polygon may
be offset by a single value that is computed for that polygon. The function that
determines this value is speci?ed by calling
void PolygonOffset(float factor,float units );
factor scales the maximum depth slope of the polygon, and units scales an im-
plementation dependent constant that relates to the usable resolution of the depth
buffer. The resulting values are summed to produce the polygon offset value. Both
factor and units may be either positive or negative.
The maximum depth slopem of a triangle is

If the polygon has more than three vertices, one or more values ofm may be used
during rasterization. Each may take any value in the range [min,max], wheremin
andmax are the smallest and largest values obtained by evaluating equation 3.9 or
equation 3.10 for the triangles formed by all three-vertex combinations.
The minimum resolvable differencer is an implementation constant. It is the
smallest difference in window coordinate z values that is guaranteed to remain
distinct throughout polygon rasterization and in the depth buffer. All pairs of frag-
ments generated by the rasterization of two polygons with otherwise identical ver-
tices, butz values that differ byr, will have distinct depth values.
w
The offset valueo for a polygon is
o =m? factor+r? units. (3.11)
m is computed as described above, as a function of depth values in the range [0,1],
ando is applied to depth values in the same range.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.5. POLYGONS 113
Boolean state valuesPOLYGON OFFSET POINT,POLYGON OFFSET LINE, and
POLYGON OFFSET FILL determine whether o is applied during the rasterization
of polygons in POINT, LINE, and FILL modes. These boolean state values are
enabled and disabled as argument values to the commands Enable and Disable. If
POLYGON OFFSET POINT is enabled, o is added to the depth value of each frag-
ment produced by the rasterization of a polygon in POINT mode. Likewise, if
POLYGON OFFSET LINE or POLYGON OFFSET FILL is enabled,o is added to the
depth value of each fragment produced by the rasterization of a polygon in LINE
orFILL modes, respectively.
Fragment depth values are always limited to the range [0,1], either by clamping
after offset addition is performed (preferred), or by clamping the vertex values used
in the rasterization of the polygon.
3.5.6 Polygon Multisample Rasterization
IfMULTISAMPLE is enabled and the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is one, then poly-
gons are rasterized using the following algorithm, regardless of whether polygon
antialiasing (POLYGON SMOOTH) is enabled or disabled. Polygon rasterization pro-
duces a fragment for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that
satisfy the point sampling criteria described in section 3.5.1, including the special
treatment for sample points that lie on a polygon boundary edge. If a polygon is
culled, based on its orientation and the CullFace mode, then no fragments are pro-
duced during rasterization. Fragments are culled by the polygon stipple just as they
are for aliased and antialiased polygons.
Coverage bits that correspond to sample points that satisfy the point sampling
criteria are 1, other coverage bits are 0. Each color, depth, and set of texture co-
ordinates is produced by substituting the corresponding sample location into the
barycentric equations described in section 3.5.1, using the approximation to equa-
tion 3.8 that omits w components. An implementation may choose to assign the
same color value and the same set of texture coordinates to more than one sample
by barycentric evaluation using any location with the pixel including the fragment
center or one of the sample locations. The color value and the set of texture coor-
dinates need not be evaluated at the same location.
The rasterization described above applies only to the FILL state of Polygon-
Mode. For POINT and LINE, the rasterizations described in sections 3.3.3 (Point
Multisample Rasterization) and 3.4.4 (Line Multisample Rasterization) apply.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 114
3.5.7 Polygon Rasterization State
The state required for polygon rasterization consists of a polygon stipple pattern,
whether stippling is enabled or disabled, the current state of polygon antialiasing
(enabled or disabled), the current values of the PolygonMode setting for each of
front and back facing polygons, whether point, line, and ?ll mode polygon offsets
are enabled or disabled, and the factor and bias values of the polygon offset equa-
tion. The initial stipple pattern is all ones; initially stippling is disabled. The initial
setting of polygon antialiasing is disabled. The initial state for PolygonMode is
FILL for both front and back facing polygons. The initial polygon offset factor
and bias values are both 0; initially polygon offset is disabled for all modes.
3.6 Pixel Rectangles
Rectangles of color, depth, and certain other values may be converted to fragments
using the DrawPixels command (described in section 3.6.4). Some of the param-
eters and operations governing the operation of DrawPixels are shared by Read-
Pixels (used to obtain pixel values from the framebuffer) and CopyPixels (used to
copy pixels from one framebuffer location to another); the discussion of ReadPix-
els and CopyPixels, however, is deferred until chapter 4 after the framebuffer has
been discussed in detail. Nevertheless, we note in this section when parameters
and state pertaining to DrawPixels also pertain to ReadPixels or CopyPixels.
A number of parameters control the encoding of pixels in client memory (for
reading and writing) and how pixels are processed before being placed in or after
being read from the framebuffer (for reading, writing, and copying). These param-
eters are set with three commands: PixelStore, PixelTransfer, and PixelMap.
3.6.1 Pixel Storage Modes
Pixel storage modes affect the operation of DrawPixels and ReadPixels (as well as
other commands; see sections 3.5.2, 3.7, and 3.8) when one of these commands is
issued. This may differ from the time that the command is executed if the command
is placed in a display list (see section 5.4). Pixel storage modes are set with
void PixelStore{if}(enum pname,T param );
pname is a symbolic constant indicating a parameter to be set, and param is the
value to set it to. Table 3.1 summarizes the pixel storage parameters, their types,
their initial values, and their allowable ranges. Setting a parameter to a value out-
side the given range results in the errorINVALID VALUE.

The version of PixelStore that takes a ?oating-point value may be used to
set any type of parameter; if the parameter is boolean, then it is set to FALSE if
the passed value is 0.0 and TRUE otherwise, while if the parameter is an integer,
then the passed value is rounded to the nearest integer. The integer version of
the command may also be used to set any type of parameter; if the parameter is
boolean, then it is set toFALSE if the passed value is0 andTRUE otherwise, while
if the parameter is a ?oating-point value, then the passed value is converted to
?oating-point.
3.6.2 The Imaging Subset
Some pixel transfer and per-fragment operations are only made available in GL
implementations which incorporate the optional imaging subset. The imaging
subset includes both new commands, and new enumerants allowed as parame-
ters to existing commands. If the subset is supported, all of these calls and enu-
merants must be implemented as described later in the GL speci?cation. If the
subset is not supported, calling any unsupported command generates the error
INVALID OPERATION, and using any of the new enumerants generates the error
INVALID ENUM.
The individual operations available only in the imaging subset are described in
section 3.6.3. Imaging subset operations include:
1. Color tables, including all commands and enumerants described in sub-
sections Color Table Specification, Alternate Color Table Specification
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 116
Commands, Color Table State and Proxy State, Color Table Lookup,
Post Convolution Color Table Lookup, and Post Color Matrix Color Ta-
ble Lookup, as well as the query commands described in section 6.1.7.
2. Convolution, including all commands and enumerants described in sub-
sections Convolution Filter Specification, Alternate Convolution Filter
Specification Commands, and Convolution, as well as the query com-
mands described in section 6.1.8.
3. Color matrix, including all commands and enumerants described in subsec-
tions Color Matrix Specification and Color Matrix Transformation, as
well as the simple query commands described in section 6.1.6.
4. Histogram and minmax, including all commands and enumerants described
in subsections Histogram Table Specification, Histogram State and
Proxy State, Histogram, Minmax Table Specification, and Minmax, as
well as the query commands described in section 6.1.9 and section 6.1.10.
The imaging subset is supported only if the EXTENSIONS string includes the
substring"ARB imaging". QueryingEXTENSIONS is described in section 6.1.11.
If the imaging subset is not supported, the related pixel transfer operations are
not performed; pixels are passed unchanged to the next operation.
3.6.3 Pixel Transfer Modes
Pixel transfer modes affect the operation of DrawPixels (section 3.6.4), ReadPix-
els (section 4.3.2), and CopyPixels (section 4.3.3) at the time when one of these
commands is executed (which may differ from the time the command is issued).
Some pixel transfer modes are set with
void PixelTransfer{if}(enum param,T value );
param is a symbolic constant indicating a parameter to be set, and value is the value
to set it to. Table 3.2 summarizes the pixel transfer parameters that are set with
PixelTransfer, their types, their initial values, and their allowable ranges. Setting
a parameter to a value outside the given range results in the errorINVALID VALUE.
The same versions of the command exist as for PixelStore, and the same rules
apply to accepting and converting passed values to set parameters.
The pixel map lookup tables are set with
void PixelMap{ui us f}v(enum map,sizei size,T values );

map is a symbolic map name, indicating the map to set, size indicates the size of
the map, and values is a pointer to an array of size map values.
The entries of a table may be speci?ed using one of three types: single-
precision ?oating-point, unsigned short integer, or unsigned integer, depending on
which of the three versions of PixelMap is called. A table entry is converted
to the appropriate type when it is speci?ed. An entry giving a color component
value is converted according to table 2.9. An entry giving a color index value
is converted from an unsigned short integer or unsigned integer to ?oating-point.
An entry giving a stencil index is converted from single-precision ?oating-point
to an integer by rounding to nearest. The various tables and their initial sizes
and entries are summarized in table 3.3. A table that takes an index as an ad-
n
dress must have size = 2 or the error INVALID VALUE results. The maximum
allowable size of each table is speci?ed by the implementation dependent value
MAX PIXEL MAP TABLE, but must be at least 32 (a single maximum applies to all
tables). The error INVALID VALUE is generated if a size larger than the imple-
mented maximum, or less than one, is given to PixelMap.
Color Table Specification
Color lookup tables are speci?ed with
void ColorTable(enum target,enum internalformat,
sizei width,enum format,enum type,void *data );

target must be one of the regular color table names listed in table 3.4 to de?ne
the table. A proxy table name is a special case discussed later in this section.
width, format, type, and data specify an image in memory with the same mean-
ing and allowed values as the corresponding arguments to DrawPixels (see sec-
tion 3.6.4), with height taken to be 1. The maximum allowable width of a table
is implementation-dependent, but must be at least 32. The formatsCOLOR INDEX,
DEPTH COMPONENT, andSTENCIL INDEX and the typeBITMAP are not allowed.
The speci?ed image is taken from memory and processed just as if DrawPixels
were called, stopping after the ?nal expansion to RGBA. The R, G, B, and A com-
ponents of each pixel are then scaled by the fourCOLOR TABLE SCALE parameters,
biased by the four COLOR TABLE BIAS parameters, and clamped to [0,1]. These
parameters are set by calling ColorTableParameterfv as described below.
Components are then selected from the resulting R, G, B, and A values to
obtain a table with the base internal format speci?ed by (or derived from) inter-
nalformat, in the same manner as for textures (section 3.8.1). internalformat must
be one of the formats in table 3.15 or table 3.16, other than the DEPTH formats in
those tables.
The color lookup table is rede?ned to have width entries, each with the speci-
?ed internal format. The table is formed with indices 0 throughwidth? 1. Table
locationi is speci?ed by theith image pixel, counting from zero.
The error INVALID VALUE is generated if width is not zero or a non-negative
power of two. The error TABLE TOO LARGE is generated if the speci?ed color
lookup table is too large for the implementation.
The scale and bias parameters for a table are speci?ed by calling

Table 3.4: Color table names. Regular tables have associated image data. Proxy
tables have no image data, and are used only to determine if an image can be loaded
into the corresponding regular table.
void ColorTableParameter{if}v(enum target,enum pname,
T params );
target must be a regular color table name. pname is one of COLOR TABLE SCALE
orCOLOR TABLE BIAS. params points to an array of four values: red, green, blue,
and alpha, in that order.
A GL implementation may vary its allocation of internal component resolution
based on any ColorTable parameter, but the allocation must not be a function of
any other factor, and cannot be changed once it is established. Allocations must
be invariant; the same allocation must be made each time a color table is speci?ed
with the same parameter values. These allocation rules also apply to proxy color
tables, which are described later in this section.
Alternate Color Table Specification Commands
Color tables may also be speci?ed using image data taken directly from the frame-
buffer, and portions of existing tables may be respeci?ed.
The command
void CopyColorTable(enum target,enum internalformat,
int x,int y,sizei width );
de?nes a color table in exactly the manner of ColorTable, except that table data
are taken from the framebuffer, rather than from client memory. target must be a
regular color table name. x, y, and width correspond precisely to the corresponding
arguments of CopyPixels (refer to section 4.3.3); they specify the image’s width
and the lower left (x,y) coordinates of the framebuffer region to be copied. The
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 120
image is taken from the framebuffer exactly as if these arguments were passed to
CopyPixels with argument type set toCOLOR and height set to 1, stopping after the
?nal expansion to RGBA.
Subsequent processing is identical to that described for ColorTable, beginning
with scaling byCOLOR TABLE SCALE. Parameters target, internalformat and width
are speci?ed using the same values, with the same meanings, as the equivalent
arguments of ColorTable. format is taken to beRGBA.
Two additional commands,
void ColorSubTable(enum target,sizei start,sizei count,
enum format,enum type,void *data );
void CopyColorSubTable(enum target,sizei start,int x,
int y,sizei count );
respecify only a portion of an existing color table. No change is made to the inter-
nalformat or width parameters of the speci?ed color table, nor is any change made
to table entries outside the speci?ed portion. target must be a regular color table
name.
ColorSubTable arguments format, type, and data match the corresponding ar-
guments to ColorTable, meaning that they are speci?ed using the same values,
and have the same meanings. Likewise, CopyColorSubTable arguments x, y, and
count match the x, y, and width arguments of CopyColorTable. Both of the Color-
SubTable commands interpret and process pixel groups in exactly the manner of
their ColorTable counterparts, except that the assignment of R, G, B, and A pixel
group values to the color table components is controlled by the internalformat of
the table, not by an argument to the command.
Arguments start and count of ColorSubTable and CopyColorSubTable spec-
ify a subregion of the color table starting at index start and ending at index
start + count? 1. Counting from zero, the nth pixel group is assigned to the
table entry with index count + n. The error INVALID VALUE is generated if
start+count>width.
Color Table State and Proxy State
The state necessary for color tables can be divided into two categories. For each
of the three tables, there is an array of values. Each array has associated with it
a width, an integer describing the internal format of the table, six integer values
describing the resolutions of each of the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and
intensity components of the table, and two groups of four ?oating-point numbers to
store the table scale and bias. Each initial array is null (zero width, internal format
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 121
RGBA, with zero-sized components). The initial value of the scale parameters is
(1,1,1,1) and the initial value of the bias parameters is (0,0,0,0).
In addition to the color lookup tables, partially instantiated proxy color lookup
tables are maintained. Each proxy table includes width and internal format state
values, as well as state for the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and intensity
component resolutions. Proxy tables do not include image data, nor do they in-
clude scale and bias parameters. When ColorTable is executed with target speci-
?ed as one of the proxy color table names listed in table 3.4, the proxy state values
of the table are recomputed and updated. If the table is too large, no error is gener-
ated, but the proxy format, width and component resolutions are set to zero. If the
color table would be accommodated by ColorTable called with target set to the
corresponding regular table name (COLOR TABLE is the regular name correspond-
ing to PROXY COLOR TABLE, for example), the proxy state values are set exactly
as though the regular table were being speci?ed. Calling ColorTable with a proxy
target has no effect on the image or state of any actual color table.
There is no image associated with any of the proxy targets. They cannot be
used as color tables, and they must never be queried using GetColorTable. The
errorINVALID ENUM is generated if this is attempted.
Convolution Filter Specification
A two-dimensional convolution ?lter image is speci?ed by calling
void ConvolutionFilter2D(enum target,enum internalformat,
sizei width,sizei height,enum format,enum type,
void *data );
target must beCONVOLUTION 2D. width, height, format, type, and data specify an
image in memory with the same meaning and allowed values as the corresponding
parameters to DrawPixels. The formats COLOR INDEX, DEPTH COMPONENT, and
STENCIL INDEX and the typeBITMAP are not allowed.
The speci?ed image is extracted from memory and processed just as if
DrawPixels were called, stopping after the ?nal expansion to RGBA. The
R, G, B, and A components of each pixel are then scaled by the four two-
dimensional CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE parameters and biased by the four
two-dimensionalCONVOLUTION FILTER BIAS parameters. These parameters are
set by calling ConvolutionParameterfv as described below. No clamping takes
place at any time during this process.
Components are then selected from the resulting R, G, B, and A values to
obtain a table with the base internal format speci?ed by (or derived from) inter-
nalformat, in the same manner as for textures (section 3.8.1). internalformat must
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 122
be one of the formats in table 3.15 or table 3.16, other than the DEPTH formats in
those tables.
The red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and/or intensity components of the
pixels are stored in ?oating point, rather than integer format. They form a two-
dimensional image indexed with coordinatesi,j such thati increases from left to
right, starting at zero, and j increases from bottom to top, also starting at zero.
Image locationi,j is speci?ed by theNth pixel, counting from zero, where
N =i+j? width
The error INVALID VALUE is generated if width or height is greater
than the maximum supported value. These values are queried with Get-
ConvolutionParameteriv, setting target to CONVOLUTION 2D and pname to
MAX CONVOLUTION WIDTH orMAX CONVOLUTION HEIGHT, respectively.
The scale and bias parameters for a two-dimensional ?lter are speci?ed by
calling
void ConvolutionParameter{if}v(enum target,enum pname,
T params );
with target CONVOLUTION 2D. pname is one of CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE
or CONVOLUTION FILTER BIAS. params points to an array of four values: red,
green, blue, and alpha, in that order.
A one-dimensional convolution ?lter is de?ned using
void ConvolutionFilter1D(enum target,enum internalformat,
sizei width,enum format,enum type,void *data );
target must be CONVOLUTION 1D. internalformat, width, format, and type have
identical semantics and accept the same values as do their two-dimensional coun-
terparts. data must point to a one-dimensional image, however.
The image is extracted from memory and processed as if ConvolutionFilter2D
were called with a height of 1, except that it is scaled and biased by the one-
dimensional CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE and CONVOLUTION FILTER BIAS
parameters. These parameters are speci?ed exactly as the two-dimensional
parameters, except that ConvolutionParameterfv is called with target
CONVOLUTION 1D.
The image is formed with coordinatesi such thati increases from left to right,
starting at zero. Image locationi is speci?ed by theith pixel, counting from zero.
The error INVALID VALUE is generated if width is greater than the maximum
supported value. This value is queried using GetConvolutionParameteriv, setting
target toCONVOLUTION 1D and pname toMAX CONVOLUTION WIDTH.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 123
Special facilities are provided for the de?nition of two-dimensional sepa-
rable ?lters – ?lters whose image can be represented as the product of two
one-dimensional images, rather than as full two-dimensional images. A two-
dimensional separable convolution ?lter is speci?ed with
void SeparableFilter2D(enum target,enum internalformat,
sizei width,sizei height,enum format,enum type,
void *row,void *column );
target must be SEPARABLE 2D. internalformat speci?es the formats of the table
entries of the two one-dimensional images that will be retained. row points to a
width pixel wide image of the speci?ed format and type. column points to a height
pixel high image, also of the speci?ed format and type.
The two images are extracted from memory and processed as if Convolu-
tionFilter1D were called separately for each, except that each image is scaled
and biased by the two-dimensional separable CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE and
CONVOLUTION FILTER BIAS parameters. These parameters are speci?ed exactly
as the one-dimensional and two-dimensional parameters, except that Convolution-
Parameteriv is called with targetSEPARABLE 2D.
Alternate Convolution Filter Specification Commands
One and two-dimensional ?lters may also be speci?ed using image data taken di-
rectly from the framebuffer.
The command
void CopyConvolutionFilter2D(enum target,
enum internalformat,int x,int y,sizei width,
sizei height );
de?nes a two-dimensional ?lter in exactly the manner of ConvolutionFilter2D,
except that image data are taken from the framebuffer, rather than from client mem-
ory. target must beCONVOLUTION 2D. x, y, width, and height correspond precisely
to the corresponding arguments of CopyPixels (refer to section 4.3.3); they specify
the image’s width and height, and the lower left (x,y) coordinates of the frame-
buffer region to be copied. The image is taken from the framebuffer exactly as
if these arguments were passed to CopyPixels with argument type set to COLOR,
stopping after the ?nal expansion to RGBA.
Subsequent processing is identical to that described for ConvolutionFilter2D,
beginning with scaling by CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE. Parameters target, in-
ternalformat, width, and height are speci?ed using the same values, with the same
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 124
meanings, as the equivalent arguments of ConvolutionFilter2D. format is taken to
beRGBA.
The command
void CopyConvolutionFilter1D(enum target,
enum internalformat,int x,int y,sizei width );
de?nes a one-dimensional ?lter in exactly the manner of ConvolutionFilter1D,
except that image data are taken from the framebuffer, rather than from client mem-
ory. target must beCONVOLUTION 1D. x, y, and width correspond precisely to the
corresponding arguments of CopyPixels (refer to section 4.3.3); they specify the
image’s width and the lower left (x,y) coordinates of the framebuffer region to
be copied. The image is taken from the framebuffer exactly as if these arguments
were passed to CopyPixels with argument type set to COLOR and height set to 1,
stopping after the ?nal expansion to RGBA.
Subsequent processing is identical to that described for ConvolutionFilter1D,
beginning with scaling by CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE. Parameters target, in-
ternalformat, and width are speci?ed using the same values, with the same mean-
ings, as the equivalent arguments of ConvolutionFilter2D. format is taken to be
RGBA.
Convolution Filter State
The required state for convolution ?lters includes a one-dimensional image array,
two one-dimensional image arrays for the separable ?lter, and a two-dimensional
image array. Each ?lter has associated with it a width and height (two-dimensional
and separable only), an integer describing the internal format of the ?lter, and two
groups of four ?oating-point numbers to store the ?lter scale and bias.
Each initial convolution ?lter is null (zero width and height, internal format
RGBA, with zero-sized components). The initial value of all scale parameters is
(1,1,1,1) and the initial value of all bias parameters is (0,0,0,0).
Color Matrix Specification
Setting the matrix mode to COLOR causes the matrix operations described in sec-
tion 2.11.2 to apply to the top matrix on the color matrix stack. All matrix opera-
tions have the same effect on the color matrix as they do on the other matrices.
Histogram Table Specification
The histogram table is speci?ed with
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 125
void Histogram(enum target,sizei width,
enum internalformat,boolean sink );
target must be HISTOGRAM if a histogram table is to be speci?ed. target value
PROXY HISTOGRAM is a special case discussed later in this section. width speci-
?es the number of entries in the histogram table, and internalformat speci?es the
format of each table entry. The maximum allowable width of the histogram table
is implementation-dependent, but must be at least 32. sink speci?es whether pixel
groups will be consumed by the histogram operation (TRUE) or passed on to the
minmax operation (FALSE).
If no error results from the execution of Histogram, the speci?ed histogram
table is rede?ned to have width entries, each with the speci?ed internal format.
The entries are indexed 0 throughwidth? 1. Each component in each entry is set
to zero. The values in the previous histogram table, if any, are lost.
The error INVALID VALUE is generated if width is not zero or a non-negative
power of two. The errorTABLE TOO LARGE is generated if the speci?ed histogram
table is too large for the implementation. The errorINVALID ENUM is generated if
internalformat is not one of the formats in table 3.15 or table 3.16, or is 1, 2, 3, 4,
or any of theDEPTH orINTENSITY formats in those tables.
A GL implementation may vary its allocation of internal component resolution
based on any Histogram parameter, but the allocation must not be a function of any
other factor, and cannot be changed once it is established. In particular, allocations
must be invariant; the same allocation must be made each time a histogram is
speci?ed with the same parameter values. These allocation rules also apply to the
proxy histogram, which is described later in this section.
Histogram State and Proxy State
The state necessary for histogram operation is an array of values, with which is
associated a width, an integer describing the internal format of the histogram, ?ve
integer values describing the resolutions of each of the red, green, blue, alpha,
and luminance components of the table, and a ?ag indicating whether or not pixel
groups are consumed by the operation. The initial array is null (zero width, internal
formatRGBA, with zero-sized components). The initial value of the ?ag is false.
In addition to the histogram table, a partially instantiated proxy histogram table
is maintained. It includes width, internal format, and red, green, blue, alpha, and
luminance component resolutions. The proxy table does not include image data or
the ?ag. When Histogram is executed with target set to PROXY HISTOGRAM, the
proxy state values are recomputed and updated. If the histogram array is too large,
no error is generated, but the proxy format, width, and component resolutions are
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 126
set to zero. If the histogram table would be accomodated by Histogram called
with target set to HISTOGRAM, the proxy state values are set exactly as though
the actual histogram table were being speci?ed. Calling Histogram with target
PROXY HISTOGRAM has no effect on the actual histogram table.
There is no image associated with PROXY HISTOGRAM. It cannot be used as
a histogram, and its image must never queried using GetHistogram. The error
INVALID ENUM results if this is attempted.
Minmax Table Specification
The minmax table is speci?ed with
void Minmax(enum target,enum internalformat,
boolean sink );
target must be MINMAX. internalformat speci?es the format of the table entries.
sink speci?es whether pixel groups will be consumed by the minmax operation
(TRUE) or passed on to ?nal conversion (FALSE).
The error INVALID ENUM is generated if internalformat is not one of the for-
mats in table 3.15 or table 3.16, or is 1, 2, 3, 4, or any of theDEPTH orINTENSITY
formats in those tables. The resulting table always has 2 entries, each with values
corresponding only to the components of the internal format.
The state necessary for minmax operation is a table containing two elements
(the ?rst element stores the minimum values, the second stores the maximum val-
ues), an integer describing the internal format of the table, and a ?ag indicating
whether or not pixel groups are consumed by the operation. The initial state is
a minimum table entry set to the maximum representable value and a maximum
table entry set to the minimum representable value. Internal format is set toRGBA
and the initial value of the ?ag is false.
3.6.4 Rasterization of Pixel Rectangles
The process of drawing pixels encoded in host memory is diagrammed in ?g-
ure 3.7. We describe the stages of this process in the order in which they occur.
Pixels are drawn using
void DrawPixels(sizei width,sizei height,enum format,
enum type,void *data );
format is a symbolic constant indicating what the values in memory represent.
width and height are the width and height, respectively, of the pixel rectangle to

Table 3.6: DrawPixels and ReadPixels formats. The second column gives a de-
scription of and the number and order of elements in a group. Unless speci?ed as
an index, formats yield components.
Unpacking
Data are taken from host memory as a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes (GL
data types byte and ubyte), signed or unsigned short integers (GL data types
short andushort), signed or unsigned integers (GL data typesint anduint),
or ?oating point values (GL data type float). These elements are grouped into
sets of one, two, three, or four values, depending on the format, to form a group.
Table 3.6 summarizes the format of groups obtained from memory; it also indicates
those formats that yield indices and those that yield components.
By default the values of each GL data type are interpreted as they would be
speci?ed in the language of the client’s GL binding. If UNPACK SWAP BYTES is
enabled, however, then the values are interpreted with the bit orderings modi?ed
as per table 3.7. The modi?ed bit orderings are de?ned only if the GL data type
ubyte has eight bits, and then for each speci?c GL data type only if that type is
represented with 8, 16, or 32 bits.
The groups in memory are treated as being arranged in a rectangle. This
rectangle consists of a series of rows, with the ?rst element of the ?rst group
of the ?rst row pointed to by the pointer passed to DrawPixels. If the value of
UNPACK ROW LENGTH is not positive, then the number of groups in a row is width;
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 130
Element Size Default Bit Ordering Modi?ed Bit Ordering
8 bit [7..0] [7..0]
16 bit [15..0] [7..0][15..8]
32 bit [31..0] [7..0][15..8][23..16][31..24]
Table 3.7: Bit ordering modi?cation of elements when UNPACK SWAP BYTES is
enabled. These reorderings are de?ned only when GL data typeubyte has 8 bits,
and then only for GL data types with 8, 16, or 32 bits. Bit 0 is the least signi?cant.
otherwise the number of groups is UNPACK ROW LENGTH. If p indicates the loca-
tion in memory of the ?rst element of the ?rst row, then the ?rst element of theNth
row is indicated by
p+Nk (3.12)
whereN is the row number (counting from zero) and k is de?ned as
(
nl s? a,
k = (3.13)
a/sdsnl/ae s<a
where n is the number of elements in a group, l is the number of groups in
the row, a is the value of UNPACK ALIGNMENT, and s is the size, in units of GL
ubytes, of an element. If the number of bits per element is not1, 2, 4, or8 times
the number of bits in a GLubyte, thenk =nl for all values ofa.
There is a mechanism for selecting a sub-rectangle of groups from a
larger containing rectangle. This mechanism relies on three integer parameters:
UNPACK ROW LENGTH, UNPACK SKIP ROWS, and UNPACK SKIP PIXELS. Before
obtaining the ?rst group from memory, the pointer supplied to DrawPixels is effec-
tively advanced by(UNPACK SKIP PIXELS)n+(UNPACK SKIP ROWS)k elements.
Then width groups are obtained from contiguous elements in memory (without ad-
vancing the pointer), after which the pointer is advanced byk elements. height sets
of width groups of values are obtained this way. See ?gure 3.8.

unsigned int, depending on the type. The number of components per packed pixel
is ?xed by the type, and must match the number of components per group indicated
by the format parameter, as listed in table 3.8. The errorINVALID OPERATION is
generated if a mismatch occurs. This constraint also holds for all other functions
that accept or return pixel data using type and format parameters to de?ne the type
and format of that data.
Bit?eld locations of the ?rst, second, third, and fourth components of each
packed pixel type are illustrated in tables 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. Each bit?eld is
interpreted as an unsigned integer value. If the base GL type is supported with
more than the minimum precision (e.g. a 9-bit byte) the packed components are
right-justi?ed in the pixel.
Components are normally packed with the ?rst component in the most signif-
icant bits of the bit?eld, and successive component occupying progressively less
signi?cant locations. Types whose token names end with REV reverse the compo-
nent packing order from least to most signi?cant locations. In all cases, the most
signi?cant bit of each component is packed in the most signi?cant bit location of
its location in the bit?eld.

Table 3.12: Packed pixel ?eld assignments.
The assignment of component to ?elds in the packed pixel is as described in
table 3.12
Byte swapping, if enabled, is performed before the component are extracted
from each pixel. The above discussions of row length and image extraction are
valid for packed pixels, if “group” is substituted for “component” and the number
of components per group is understood to be one.
Calling DrawPixels with a type ofBITMAP is a special case in which the data
are a series of GL ubyte values. Each ubyte value speci?es 8 1-bit elements
with its 8 least-signi?cant bits. The 8 single-bit elements are ordered from most
signi?cant to least signi?cant if the value ofUNPACK LSB FIRST isFALSE; other-
wise, the ordering is from least signi?cant to most signi?cant. The values of bits
other than the 8 least signi?cant in eachubyte are not signi?cant.
The ?rst element of the ?rst row is the ?rst bit (as de?ned above) of theubyte
pointed to by the pointer passed to DrawPixels. The ?rst element of the second
row is the ?rst bit (again as de?ned above) of theubyte at locationp+k, where
k is computed as
 
l
k =a (3.14)
8a
There is a mechanism for selecting a sub-rectangle of elements from aBITMAP
image as well. Before obtaining the ?rst element from memory, the pointer sup-
plied to DrawPixels is effectively advanced byUNPACK SKIP ROWS? kubytes.
ThenUNPACK SKIP PIXELS 1-bit elements are ignored, and the subsequent width
1-bit elements are obtained, without advancing theubyte pointer, after which the
pointer is advanced byk ubytes. height sets of width elements are obtained this
way.
Conversion to ?oating-point
This step applies only to groups of components. It is not performed on indices.
Each element in a group is converted to a ?oating-point value according to the ap-
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 136
propriate formula in table 2.9 (section 2.14). For packed pixel types, each element
N
in the group is converted by computingc/(2 ? 1), wherec is the unsigned inte-
ger value of the bit?eld containing the element andN is the number of bits in the
bit?eld.
Conversion to RGB
This step is applied only if the format isLUMINANCE orLUMINANCE ALPHA. If the
format is LUMINANCE, then each group of one element is converted to a group of
R, G, and B (three) elements by copying the original single element into each of
the three new elements. If the format is LUMINANCE ALPHA, then each group of
two elements is converted to a group of R, G, B, and A (four) elements by copying
the ?rst original element into each of the ?rst three new elements and copying the
second original element to the A (fourth) new element.
Final Expansion to RGBA
This step is performed only for non-depth component groups. Each group is con-
verted to a group of 4 elements as follows: if a group does not contain an A element,
then A is added and set to 1.0. If any of R, G, or B is missing from the group, each
missing element is added and assigned a value of 0.0.
Pixel Transfer Operations
This step is actually a sequence of steps. Because the pixel transfer operations
are performed equivalently during the drawing, copying, and reading of pixels,
and during the speci?cation of texture images (either from memory or from the
framebuffer), they are described separately in section 3.6.5. After the processing
described in that section is completed, groups are processed as described in the
following sections.
Final Conversion
For a color index, ?nal conversion consists of masking the bits of the index to the
n
left of the binary point by2 ? 1, wheren is the number of bits in an index buffer.
For RGBA components, each element is clamped to[0,1]. The resulting values are
converted to ?xed-point according to the rules given in section 2.14.9 (Final Color
Processing).
For a depth component, an element is ?rst clamped to[0,1] and then converted
to ?xed-point as if it were a window z value (see section 2.11.1, Controlling the
Viewport).
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 137
n
Stencil indices are masked by 2 ? 1, where n is the number of bits in the
stencil buffer.
Conversion to Fragments
The conversion of a group to fragments is controlled with
void PixelZoom(floatz ,floatz );
x y
Let (x ,y ) be the current raster position (section 2.13). (If the current raster
rp rp
position is invalid, then DrawPixels is ignored; pixel transfer operations do not
update the histogram or minmax tables, and no fragments are generated. However,
the histogram and minmax tables are updated even if the corresponding fragments
are later rejected by the pixel ownership (section 4.1.1) or scissor (section 4.1.2)
tests.) If a particular group (index or components) is thenth in a row and belongs to
themth row, consider the region in window coordinates bounded by the rectangle
with corners
(x +z n,y +z m) and (x +z (n+1),y +z (m+1))
rp x rp y rp x rp y
(either z or z may be negative). A fragment representing group (n,m) is pro-
x y
duced for each framebuffer pixel inside, or on the bottom or left boundary, of this
rectangle
A fragment arising from a group consisting of color data takes on the color
index or color components of the group and the current raster position’s associated
depth value, while a fragment arising from a depth component takes that compo-
nent’s depth value and the current raster position’s associated color index or color
components. In both cases, the fog coordinate is taken from the current raster posi-
tion’s associated raster distance, and texture coordinates are taken from the current
raster position’s associated texture coordinates. Groups arising from DrawPix-
els with a format of STENCIL INDEX are treated specially and are described in
section 4.3.1.
3.6.5 Pixel Transfer Operations
The GL de?nes four kinds of pixel groups:
1. RGBA component: Each group comprises four color components: red, green,
blue, and alpha.
2. Depth component: Each group comprises a single depth component.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 138
3. Color index: Each group comprises a single color index.
4. Stencil index: Each group comprises a single stencil index.
Each operation described in this section is applied sequentially to each pixel group
in an image. Many operations are applied only to pixel groups of certain kinds; if
an operation is not applicable to a given group, it is skipped.
Arithmetic on Components
This step applies only to RGBA component and depth component groups. Each
component is multiplied by an appropriate signed scale factor: RED SCALE for an
R component,GREEN SCALE for a G component,BLUE SCALE for a B component,
andALPHA SCALE for an A component, orDEPTH SCALE for a depth component.
Then the result is added to the appropriate signed bias: RED BIAS, GREEN BIAS,
BLUE BIAS,ALPHA BIAS, orDEPTH BIAS.
Arithmetic on Indices
This step applies only to color index and stencil index groups. If the index is a
?oating-point value, it is converted to ?xed-point, with an unspeci?ed number of
bits to the right of the binary point and at leastdlog (MAX PIXEL MAP TABLE)e
2
bits to the left of the binary point. Indices that are already integers remain so; any
fraction bits in the resulting ?xed-point value are zero.
The ?xed-point index is then shifted by |INDEX SHIFT| bits, left if
INDEX SHIFT> 0 and right otherwise. In either case the shift is zero-?lled. Then,
the signed integer offsetINDEX OFFSET is added to the index.
RGBA to RGBA Lookup
This step applies only to RGBA component groups, and is skipped ifMAP COLOR is
FALSE. First, each component is clamped to the range[0,1]. There is a table associ-
ated with each of the R, G, B, and A component elements: PIXEL MAP R TO R for
R, PIXEL MAP G TO G for G, PIXEL MAP B TO B for B, and PIXEL MAP A TO A
for A. Each element is multiplied by an integer one less than the size of the corre-
sponding table, and, for each element, an address is found by rounding this value
to the nearest integer. For each element, the addressed value in the corresponding
table replaces the element.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 139
Color Index Lookup
This step applies only to color index groups. If the GL command that invokes the
pixel transfer operation requires that RGBA component pixel groups be generated,
then a conversion is performed at this step. RGBA component pixel groups are
required if
1. The groups will be rasterized, and the GL is in RGBA mode, or
2. The groups will be loaded as an image into texture memory, or
3. The groups will be returned to client memory with a format other than
COLOR INDEX.
If RGBA component groups are required, then the integer part of the in-
dex is used to reference 4 tables of color components: PIXEL MAP I TO R,
PIXEL MAP I TO G, PIXEL MAP I TO B, and PIXEL MAP I TO A. Each of these
n
tables must have 2 entries for some integer value of n (n may be different for
each table). For each table, the index is ?rst rounded to the nearest integer; the
n
result is ANDed with 2 ? 1, and the resulting value used as an address into the
table. The indexed value becomes an R, G, B, or A value, as appropriate. The
group of four elements so obtained replaces the index, changing the group’s type
to RGBA component.
If RGBA component groups are not required, and if MAP COLOR is enabled,
then the index is looked up in the PIXEL MAP I TO I table (otherwise, the index
n
is not looked up). Again, the table must have 2 entries for some integer n. The
n
index is ?rst rounded to the nearest integer; the result is ANDed with 2 ? 1, and
the resulting value used as an address into the table. The value in the table replaces
the index. The ?oating-point table value is ?rst rounded to a ?xed-point value with
unspeci?ed precision. The group’s type remains color index.
Stencil Index Lookup
This step applies only to stencil index groups. If MAP STENCIL is enabled, then
the index is looked up in thePIXEL MAP S TO S table (otherwise, the index is not
n
looked up). The table must have 2 entries for some integern. The integer index
n
is ANDed with 2 ? 1, and the resulting value used as an address into the table.
The integer value in the table replaces the index.
Color Table Lookup
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. Color table lookup is only
done if COLOR TABLE is enabled. If a zero-width table is enabled, no lookup is

performed.
The internal format of the table determines which components of the group
will be replaced (see table 3.13). The components to be replaced are converted
to indices by clamping to [0,1], multiplying by an integer one less than the width
of the table, and rounding to the nearest integer. Components are replaced by the
table entry at the index.
The required state is one bit indicating whether color table lookup is enabled
or disabled. In the initial state, lookup is disabled.
Convolution
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. If CONVOLUTION 1D
is enabled, the one-dimensional convolution ?lter is applied only to the one-
dimensional texture images passed to TexImage1D, TexSubImage1D, Copy-
TexImage1D, and CopyTexSubImage1D. If CONVOLUTION 2D is enabled, the
two-dimensional convolution ?lter is applied only to the two-dimensional im-
ages passed to DrawPixels, CopyPixels, ReadPixels, TexImage2D, TexSubIm-
age2D, CopyTexImage2D, CopyTexSubImage2D, and CopyTexSubImage3D.
If SEPARABLE 2D is enabled, and CONVOLUTION 2D is disabled, the separable
two-dimensional convolution ?lter is instead applied these images.
The convolution operation is a sum of products of source image pixels and
convolution ?lter pixels. Source image pixels always have four components: red,
green, blue, and alpha, denoted in the equations below as R , G , B , and A .

f
wise, if eitherW orH of a two-dimensional ?lter is zero, thenC[i,j] is always
f f
set to zero.
The convolution border mode for a speci?c convolution ?lter is speci?ed by
calling
void ConvolutionParameter{if}(enum target,enum pname,
T param );
where target is the name of the ?lter, pname isCONVOLUTION BORDER MODE, and
param is one ofREDUCE,CONSTANT BORDER orREPLICATE BORDER.
Border ModeREDUCE
The width and height of source images convolved with border mode REDUCE are
reduced by W ? 1 and H ? 1, respectively. If this reduction would generate
f f
a resulting image with zero or negative width and/or height, the output is simply
null, with no error generated. The coordinates of the image that results from a con-
volution with border modeREDUCE are zero throughW ? W in width, and zero
s f
throughH ? H in height. In cases where errors can result from the speci?cation
s f
of invalid image dimensions, it is these resulting dimensions that are tested, not
the dimensions of the source image. (A speci?c example is TexImage1D and Tex-
Image2D, which specify constraints for image dimensions. Even if TexImage1D
or TexImage2D is called with a null pixel pointer, the dimensions of the result-
ing texture image are those that would result from the convolution of the speci?ed
image).

Border ModeCONSTANT BORDER
If the convolution border mode is CONSTANT BORDER, the output image has the
same dimensions as the source image. The result of the convolution is the same
as if the source image were surrounded by pixels with the same color as the
current convolution border color. Whenever the convolution ?lter extends be-
yond one of the edges of the source image, the constant-color border pixels are
used as input to the ?lter. The current convolution border color is set by call-
ing ConvolutionParameterfv or ConvolutionParameteriv with pname set to
CONVOLUTION BORDER COLOR and params containing four values that comprise
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 143
the RGBA color to be used as the image border. Integer color components are
interpreted linearly such that the most positive integer maps to 1.0, and the most
negative integer maps to -1.0. Floating point color components are not clamped
when they are speci?ed.

Border ModeREPLICATE BORDER
The convolution border mode REPLICATE BORDER also produces an output im-
age with the same dimensions as the source image. The behavior of this mode is
identical to that of the CONSTANT BORDER mode except for the treatment of pixel
locations where the convolution ?lter extends beyond the edge of the source im-
age. For these locations, it is as if the outermost one-pixel border of the source
image was replicated. Conceptually, each pixel in the leftmost one-pixel column
of the source image is replicatedC times to provide additional image data along
w
the left edge, each pixel in the rightmost one-pixel column is replicatedC times
w
to provide additional image data along the right edge, and each pixel value in the
top and bottom one-pixel rows is replicated to createC rows of image data along
h
the top and bottom edges. The pixel value at each corner is also replicated in order
to provide data for the convolution operation at each corner of the source image.

If a convolution operation is performed, each component of
the resulting image is scaled by the corresponding PixelTrans-
fer parameters: POST CONVOLUTION RED SCALE for an R com-
ponent, POST CONVOLUTION GREEN SCALE for a G compo-
nent, POST CONVOLUTION BLUE SCALE for a B component, and
POST CONVOLUTION ALPHA SCALE for an A component. The result
is added to the corresponding bias: POST CONVOLUTION RED BIAS,
POST CONVOLUTION GREEN BIAS, POST CONVOLUTION BLUE BIAS, or
POST CONVOLUTION ALPHA BIAS.
The required state is three bits indicating whether each of one-dimensional,
two-dimensional, or separable two-dimensional convolution is enabled or disabled,
an integer describing the current convolution border mode, and four ?oating-point
values specifying the convolution border color. In the initial state, all convolu-
tion operations are disabled, the border mode is REDUCE, and the border color is
(0,0,0,0).
Post Convolution Color Table Lookup
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. Post convolution color
table lookup is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with
the symbolic constant POST CONVOLUTION COLOR TABLE. The post convo-
lution table is de?ned by calling ColorTable with a target argument of
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 145
POST CONVOLUTION COLOR TABLE. In all other respects, operation is identical
to color table lookup, as de?ned earlier in section 3.6.5.
The required state is one bit indicating whether post convolution table lookup
is enabled or disabled. In the initial state, lookup is disabled.
Color Matrix Transformation
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. The components are
transformed by the color matrix. Each transformed component is multiplied
by an appropriate signed scale factor: POST COLOR MATRIX RED SCALE
for an R component, POST COLOR MATRIX GREEN SCALE for a G
component, POST COLOR MATRIX BLUE SCALE for a B component,
and POST COLOR MATRIX ALPHA SCALE for an A component. The
result is added to a signed bias: POST COLOR MATRIX RED BIAS,
POST COLOR MATRIX GREEN BIAS, POST COLOR MATRIX BLUE BIAS, or
POST COLOR MATRIX ALPHA BIAS. The resulting components replace each
component of the original group.

Post Color Matrix Color Table Lookup
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. Post color matrix
color table lookup is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable
with the symbolic constant POST COLOR MATRIX COLOR TABLE. The post color
matrix table is de?ned by calling ColorTable with a target argument of
POST COLOR MATRIX COLOR TABLE. In all other respects, operation is identical
to color table lookup, as de?ned in section 3.6.5.
The required state is one bit indicating whether post color matrix lookup is
enabled or disabled. In the initial state, lookup is disabled.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.6. PIXELRECTANGLES 146
Histogram
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. Histogram operation is
enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the symbolic constant
HISTOGRAM.
If the width of the table is non-zero, then indices R , G , B , and A are de-
i i i i
rived from the red, green, blue, and alpha components of each pixel group (without
modifying these components) by clamping each component to [0,1] , multiplying
by one less than the width of the histogram table, and rounding to the nearest in-
teger. If the format of the HISTOGRAM table includes red or luminance, the red or
luminance component of histogram entryR is incremented by one. If the format
i
of the HISTOGRAM table includes green, the green component of histogram entry
G is incremented by one. The blue and alpha components of histogram entries
i
B and A are incremented in the same way. If a histogram entry component is
i i
incremented beyond its maximum value, its value becomes unde?ned; this is not
an error.
If the Histogram sink parameter is FALSE, histogram operation has no effect
on the stream of pixel groups being processed. Otherwise, all RGBA pixel groups
are discarded immediately after the histogram operation is completed. Because
histogram precedes minmax, no minmax operation is performed. No pixel frag-
ments are generated, no change is made to texture memory contents, and no pixel
values are returned. However, texture object state is modi?ed whether or not pixel
groups are discarded.
Minmax
This step applies only to RGBA component groups. Minmax operation is enabled
or disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the symbolic constantMINMAX.
If the format of the minmax table includes red or luminance, the red compo-
nent value replaces the red or luminance value in the minimum table element if
and only if it is less than that component. Likewise, if the format includes red or
luminance and the red component of the group is greater than the red or luminance
value in the maximum element, the red group component replaces the red or lumi-
nance maximum component. If the format of the table includes green, the green
group component conditionally replaces the green minimum and/or maximum if
it is smaller or larger, respectively. The blue and alpha group components are
similarly tested and replaced, if the table format includes blue and/or alpha. The
internal type of the minimum and maximum component values is ?oating point,
with at least the same representable range as a ?oating point number used to rep-
resent colors (section 2.1.1). There are no semantics de?ned for the treatment of
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.7. BITMAPS 147
group component values that are outside the representable range.
If the Minmax sink parameter is FALSE, minmax operation has no effect on
the stream of pixel groups being processed. Otherwise, all RGBA pixel groups are
discarded immediately after the minmax operation is completed. No pixel frag-
ments are generated, no change is made to texture memory contents, and no pixel
values are returned. However, texture object state is modi?ed whether or not pixel
groups are discarded.
3.6.6 Pixel Rectangle Multisample Rasterization
IfMULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is one, then pixel
rectangles are rasterized using the following algorithm. Let (X ,Y ) be the cur-
rp rp
rent raster position. (If the current raster position is invalid, then DrawPixels is
ignored.) If a particular group (index or components) is the nth in a row and be-
longs to the mth row, consider the region in window coordinates bounded by the
rectangle with corners
(X +Z ? n,Y +Z ? m)
rp x rp y
and
(X +Z ? (n+1),Y +Z ? (m+1))
rp x rp y
whereZ andZ are the pixel zoom factors speci?ed by PixelZoom, and may each
x y
be either positive or negative. A fragment representing group (n,m) is produced
for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that lie inside, or on
the bottom or left boundary, of this rectangle. Each fragment so produced takes its
associated data from the group and from the current raster position, in a manner
consistent with the discussion in the Conversion to Fragments subsection of sec-
tion 3.6.4. All depth and color sample values are assigned the same value, taken
either from their group (for depth and color component groups) or from the cur-
rent raster position (if they are not). All sample values are assigned the same fog
coordinate and the same set of texture coordinates, taken from the current raster
position.
A single pixel rectangle will generate multiple, perhaps very many fragments
for the same framebuffer pixel, depending on the pixel zoom factors.
3.7 Bitmaps
Bitmaps are rectangles of zeros and ones specifying a particular pattern of frag-
ments to be produced. Each of these fragments has the same associated data. These
data are those associated with the current raster position.

Like a polygon pattern, a bitmap is unpacked from memory according to the
procedure given in section 3.6.4 for DrawPixels; it is as if the width and height
passed to that command were equal tow andh, respectively, the type wereBITMAP,
and the format were COLOR INDEX. The unpacked values (before any conversion
or arithmetic would have been performed) form a stipple pattern of zeros and ones.
See ?gure 3.9.
A bitmap sent using Bitmap is rasterized as follows. First, if the current raster
position is invalid (the valid bit is reset), the bitmap is ignored. Otherwise, a rect-
angular array of fragments is constructed, with lower left corner at
(x ,y ) = (bx ? x c,by ? y c)

and upper right corner at(x +w,y +h) wherew andh are the width and height of
ll ll
the bitmap, respectively. Fragments in the array are produced if the corresponding
bit in the bitmap is 1 and not produced otherwise. The associated data for each
fragment are those associated with the current raster position. Once the fragments
have been produced, the current raster position is updated:
(x ,y )< (x +x ,y +y ).
rp rp rp bi rp bi
Thez andw values of the current raster position remain unchanged.
Bitmap Multisample Rasterization
If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is one, then
bitmaps are rasterized using the following algorithm. If the current raster position
is invalid, the bitmap is ignored. Otherwise, a screen-aligned array of pixel-size
rectangles is constructed, with its lower left corner at (X ,Y ), and its upper
rp rp
right corner at (X + w,Y + h), where w and h are the width and height of
rp rp
the bitmap. Rectangles in this array are eliminated if the corresponding bit in the
bitmap is 0, and are retained otherwise. Bitmap rasterization produces a fragment
for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points either inside or on the
bottom or left edge of a retained rectangle.
Coverage bits that correspond to sample points either inside or on the bottom
or left edge of a retained rectangle are 1, other coverage bits are 0. The associated
data for each sample are those associated with the current raster position. Once the
fragments have been produced, the current raster position is updated exactly as it
is in the single-sample rasterization case.
3.8 Texturing
Texturing maps a portion of one or more speci?ed images onto each primitive for
which texturing is enabled. This mapping is accomplished by using the color of an
image at the location indicated by a fragment’s (s,t,r,q) coordinates to modify
the fragment’s primary RGBA color. Texturing does not affect the secondary color.
Implementations must support texturing using at least two images at a time.
The fragment carries multiple sets of texture coordinates (s,t,r,q) which are
used to index separate images to produce color values which are collectively used
to modify the fragment’s RGBA color. Texturing is speci?ed only for RGBA mode;
its use in color index mode is unde?ned. The following subsections (up to and
including section 3.8.8) specify the GL operation with a single texture and sec-
tion 3.8.15 speci?es the details of how multiple texture units interact.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 150
The GL provides two ways to specify the details of how texturing of a prim-
itive is effected. The ?rst is referred to as ?xed-functionality, and is described in
this section. The second is referred to as a fragment shader, and is described in
section 3.11. The speci?cation of the image to be texture mapped and the means
by which the image is ?ltered when applied to the primitive are common to both
methods and are discussed in this section. The ?xed functionality method for de-
termining what RGBA value is produced is also described in this section. If a
fragment shader is active, the method for determining the RGBA value is speci?ed
by an application-supplied fragment shader as described in the OpenGL Shading
Language Specification.
When no fragment shader is active, the coordinates used for texturing are
(s/q,t/q,r/q), derived from the original texture coordinates (s,t,r,q). If the q
texture coordinate is less than or equal to zero, the coordinates used for texturing
are unde?ned. When a fragment shader is active, the (s,t,r,q) coordinates are
available to the fragment shader. The coordinates used for texturing in a fragment
shader are de?ned by the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
3.8.1 Texture Image Specification
The command
void TexImage3D(enum target,int level,int internalformat,
sizei width,sizei height,sizei depth,int border,
enum format,enum type,void *data );
is used to specify a three-dimensional texture image. target must be ei-
ther TEXTURE 3D, or PROXY TEXTURE 3D in the special case discussed in sec-
tion 3.8.11. format, type, and data match the corresponding arguments to Draw-
Pixels (refer to section 3.6.4); they specify the format of the image data, the
type of those data, and a pointer to the image data in host memory. The format
STENCIL INDEX is not allowed.
The groups in memory are treated as being arranged in a sequence of ad-
jacent rectangles. Each rectangle is a two-dimensional image, whose size and
organization are speci?ed by the width and height parameters to TexImage3D.
The values ofUNPACK ROW LENGTH andUNPACK ALIGNMENT control the row-to-
row spacing in these images in the same manner as DrawPixels. If the value of
the integer parameter UNPACK IMAGE HEIGHT is not positive, then the number
of rows in each two-dimensional image is height; otherwise the number of rows
is UNPACK IMAGE HEIGHT. Each two-dimensional image comprises an integral
number of rows, and is exactly adjacent to its neighbor images.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 151
The mechanism for selecting a sub-volume of a three-dimensional image re-
lies on the integer parameter UNPACK SKIP IMAGES. If UNPACK SKIP IMAGES
is positive, the pointer is advanced byUNPACK SKIP IMAGES times the number of
elements in one two-dimensional image before obtaining the ?rst group from mem-
ory. Then depth two-dimensional images are processed, each having a subimage
extracted in the same manner as DrawPixels.
The selected groups are processed exactly as for DrawPixels, stopping just
before ?nal conversion. Each R, G, B, A, or depth value so generated is clamped
to[0,1].
Components are then selected from the resulting R, G, B, A, or depth values to
obtain a texture with the base internal format speci?ed by (or derived from) inter-
nalformat. Table 3.15 summarizes the mapping of R, G, B, A, and depth values to
texture components, as a function of the base internal format of the texture image.
internalformat may be speci?ed as one of the seven internal format symbolic con-
stants listed in table 3.15, as one of the sized internal format symbolic constants
listed in table 3.16, as one of the speci?c compressed internal format symbolic con-
stants listed in table 3.17, or as one of the six generic compressed internal format
symbolic constants listed in table 3.18. internalformat may (for backwards com-
patibility with the 1.0 version of the GL) also take on the integer values1,2,3, and
4, which are equivalent to symbolic constants LUMINANCE, LUMINANCE ALPHA,
RGB, and RGBA respectively. Specifying a value for internalformat that is not one
of the above values generates the errorINVALID VALUE.
Textures with a base internal format of DEPTH COMPONENT are supported by
texture image speci?cation commands only if target isTEXTURE 1D,TEXTURE 2D,
PROXY TEXTURE 1D or PROXY TEXTURE 2D. Using this format in conjunction
with any other target will result in anINVALID OPERATION error.
Textures with a base internal format ofDEPTH COMPONENT require depth com-
ponent data; textures with other base internal formats require RGBA component
data. The error INVALID OPERATION is generated if the base internal format is
DEPTH COMPONENT and format is not DEPTH COMPONENT, or if the base internal
format is notDEPTH COMPONENT and format isDEPTH COMPONENT.
The GL provides no speci?c compressed internal formats but does provide a
mechanism to obtain token values for such formats provided by extensions. The
number of speci?c compressed internal formats supported by the renderer can
be obtained by querying the value ofNUM COMPRESSED TEXTURE FORMATS. The
set of speci?c compressed internal formats supported by the renderer can be ob-
tained by querying the value of COMPRESSED TEXTURE FORMATS. The only val-
ues returned by this query are those corresponding to formats suitable for general-
purpose usage. The renderer will not enumerate formats with restrictions that need
to be speci?cally understood prior to use.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 152
Generic compressed internal formats are never used directly as the internal for-
mats of texture images. If internalformat is one of the six generic compressed
internal formats, its value is replaced by the symbolic constant for a speci?c com-
pressed internal format of the GL’s choosing with the same base internal format.
If no speci?c compressed format is available, internalformat is instead replaced by
the corresponding base internal format. If internalformat is given as or mapped
to a speci?c compressed internal format, but the GL can not support images com-
pressed in the chosen internal format for any reason (e.g., the compression format
might not support 3D textures or borders), internalformat is replaced by the corre-
sponding base internal format and the texture image will not be compressed by the
GL.
The internal component resolution is the number of bits allocated to each value
in a texture image. If internalformat is speci?ed as a base internal format, the GL
stores the resulting texture with internal component resolutions of its own choos-
ing. If a sized internal format is speci?ed, the mapping of the R, G, B, A, and
depth values to texture components is equivalent to the mapping of the correspond-
ing base internal format’s components, as speci?ed in table 3.15, and the memory
allocation per texture component is assigned by the GL to match the allocations
listed in table 3.16 as closely as possible. (The de?nition of closely is left up to the
implementation. However, a non-zero number of bits must be allocated for each
component whose desired allocation in table 3.16 is non-zero, and zero bits must
be allocated for all other components. Implementations are required to support at
least one allocation of internal component resolution for each base internal format.
If a compressed internal format is speci?ed, the mapping of the R, G, B, A, and
depth values to texture components is equivalent to the mapping of the correspond-
ing base internal format’s components, as speci?ed in table 3.15. The speci?ed
image is compressed using a (possibly lossy) compression algorithm chosen by the
GL.
A GL implementation may vary its allocation of internal component resolution
or compressed internal format based on any TexImage3D, TexImage2D (see be-
low), or TexImage1D (see below) parameter (except target), but the allocation and
chosen compressed image format must not be a function of any other state and can-
not be changed once they are established. In addition, the choice of a compressed
image format may not be affected by the data parameter. Allocations must be in-
variant; the same allocation and compressed image format must be chosen each
time a texture image is speci?ed with the same parameter values. These allocation
rules also apply to proxy textures, which are described in section 3.8.11.
The image itself (pointed to by data) is a sequence of groups of values. The
?rst group is the lower left back corner of the texture image. Subsequent groups
?ll out rows of width width from left to right; height rows are stacked from bottom

The level argument to TexImage3D is an integer level-of-detail number. Levels

level of detail number of 0. If a level-of-detail less than zero is speci?ed, the error

The border argument to TexImage3D is a border width. The signi?cance of

Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 156
INVALID VALUE is generated if the speci?ed image is too large to be stored under
any conditions.
In a similar fashion, the maximum allowable width of a one- or two-
dimensional texture image, and the maximum allowable height of a two-
k? lod
dimensional texture image, must be at least 2 +2b for image arrays of level
t
0 throughk, wherek is the log base 2 of MAX TEXTURE SIZE. The maximum al-
lowable width and height of a cube map texture must be the same, and must be at
k? lod
least 2 +2b for image arrays level 0 throughk, wherek is the log base 2 of
t
MAX CUBE MAP TEXTURE SIZE.
An implementation may allow an image array of level 0 to be created only if
that single image array can be supported. Additional constraints on the creation of
image arrays of level 1 or greater are described in more detail in section 3.8.10.
The command
void TexImage2D(enum target,int level,
int internalformat,sizei width,sizei height,
int border,enum format,enum type,void *data );
is used to specify a two-dimensional texture image. target must
be one of TEXTURE 2D for a two-dimensional texture, or one of
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE X,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Y, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Y,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Z, or TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Z for
a cube map texture. Additionally, target may be either PROXY TEXTURE 2D for
a two-dimensional proxy texture or PROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP for a cube map
proxy texture in the special case discussed in section 3.8.11. The other parameters
match the corresponding parameters of TexImage3D.
For the purposes of decoding the texture image, TexImage2D is equivalent to
calling TexImage3D with corresponding arguments and depth of 1, except that
• The depth of the image is always 1 regardless of the value of border.
• Convolution will be performed on the image (possibly changing its width
and height) ifSEPARABLE 2D orCONVOLUTION 2D is enabled.
• UNPACK SKIP IMAGES is ignored.
A two-dimensional texture consists of a single two-dimensional texture image.
A cube map texture is a set of six two-dimensional texture images. The six cube
map texture targets form a single cube map texture though each target names a
distinct face of the cube map. TheTEXTURE CUBE MAP * targets listed above up-
date their appropriate cube map face 2D texture image. Note that the six cube map
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 157
two-dimensional image tokens such asTEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X are used
when specifying, updating, or querying one of a cube map’s six two-dimensional
images, but when enabling cube map texturing or binding to a cube map texture
object (that is when the cube map is accessed as a whole as opposed to a particular
two-dimensional image), theTEXTURE CUBE MAP target is speci?ed.
When the target parameter to TexImage2D is one of the six cube map two-
dimensional image targets, the errorINVALID VALUE is generated if the width and
height parameters are not equal.
Finally, the command
void TexImage1D(enum target,int level,
int internalformat,sizei width,int border,
enum format,enum type,void *data );
is used to specify a one-dimensional texture image. target must be either
TEXTURE 1D, or PROXY TEXTURE 1D in the special case discussed in sec-
tion 3.8.11.)
For the purposes of decoding the texture image, TexImage1D is equivalent to
calling TexImage2D with corresponding arguments and height of 1, except that
• The height of the image is always 1 regardless of the value of border.
• Convolution will be performed on the image (possibly changing its width)
only ifCONVOLUTION 1D is enabled.
The image indicated to the GL by the image pointer is decoded and copied into
the GL’s internal memory. This copying effectively places the decoded image in-
side a border of the maximum allowable widthb whether or not a border has been
t
1
speci?ed (see ?gure 3.10) . If no border or a border smaller than the maximum
allowable width has been speci?ed, then the image is still stored as if it were sur-
rounded by a border of the maximum possible width. Any excess border (which
surrounds the speci?ed image, including any border) is assigned unspeci?ed val-
ues. A two-dimensional texture has a border only at its left, right, top, and bottom
ends, and a one-dimensional texture has a border only at its left and right ends.
We shall refer to the (possibly border augmented) decoded image as the texture
array. A three-dimensional texture array has width, height, and depth w ,h , and
s s
d as de?ned respectively in equations 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17. A two-dimensional
s
texture array has depthd = 1, with heighth and widthw as above, and a one-
s s s
dimensional texture array has depthd = 1, heighth = 1, and widthw as above.

dimensional texture with n = 3 and m = 2. A one-dimensional texture would
consist of a single horizontal strip. ? and? , values used in blending adjacent texels
to obtain a texture value, are also shown.
An element(i,j,k) of the texture array is called a texel (for a two-dimensional
texture,k is irrelevant; for a one-dimensional texture,j andk are both irrelevant).
The texture value used in texturing a fragment is determined by that fragment’s
associated (s,t,r) coordinates, but may not correspond to any actual texel. See
?gure 3.10.
If the data argument of TexImage1D, TexImage2D, or TexImage3D is a null
pointer (a zero-valued pointer in the C implementation), a one-, two-, or three-
dimensional texture array is created with the speci?ed target, level, internalformat,
width, height, and depth, but with unspeci?ed image contents. In this case no pixel
values are accessed in client memory, and no pixel processing is performed. Errors
are generated, however, exactly as though the data pointer were valid.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 159
3.8.2 Alternate Texture Image Specification Commands
Two-dimensional and one-dimensional texture images may also be speci?ed us-
ing image data taken directly from the framebuffer, and rectangular subregions of
existing texture images may be respeci?ed.
The command
void CopyTexImage2D(enum target,int level,
enum internalformat,int x,int y,sizei width,
sizei height,int border );
de?nes a two-dimensional texture array in exactly the manner of TexIm-
age2D, except that the image data are taken from the framebuffer rather
than from client memory. Currently, target must be one of TEXTURE 2D,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE X,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Y, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Y,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Z, or TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Z. x, y,
width, and height correspond precisely to the corresponding arguments to CopyP-
ixels (refer to section 4.3.3); they specify the image’s width and height, and the
lower left (x,y) coordinates of the framebuffer region to be copied. The im-
age is taken from the framebuffer exactly as if these arguments were passed to
CopyPixels with argument type set to COLOR or DEPTH, depending on internal-
format, stopping after pixel transfer processing is complete. RGBA data is taken
from the current color buffer while depth component data is taken from the depth
buffer. If depth component data is required and no depth buffer is present, the
error INVALID OPERATION is generated. Subsequent processing is identical to
that described for TexImage2D, beginning with clamping of the R, G, B, A, or
depth values from the resulting pixel groups. Parameters level, internalformat, and
border are speci?ed using the same values, with the same meanings, as the equiv-
alent arguments of TexImage2D, except that internalformat may not be speci?ed
as 1, 2, 3, or 4. An invalid value speci?ed for internalformat generates the error
INVALID ENUM. The constraints on width, height, and border are exactly those for
the equivalent arguments of TexImage2D.
When the target parameter to CopyTexImage2D is one of the six cube map
two-dimensional image targets, the errorINVALID VALUE is generated if the width
and height parameters are not equal.
The command
void CopyTexImage1D(enum target,int level,
enum internalformat,int x,int y,sizei width,
int border );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 160
de?nes a one-dimensional texture array in exactly the manner of TexImage1D,
except that the image data are taken from the framebuffer, rather than from client
memory. Currently, target must be TEXTURE 1D. For the purposes of decoding
the texture image, CopyTexImage1D is equivalent to calling CopyTexImage2D
with corresponding arguments and height of 1, except that the height of the image
is always 1, regardless of the value of border. level, internalformat, and border
are speci?ed using the same values, with the same meanings, as the equivalent
arguments of TexImage1D, except that internalformat may not be speci?ed as 1,
2,3, or4. The constraints on width and border are exactly those of the equivalent
arguments of TexImage1D.
Six additional commands,
void TexSubImage3D(enum target,int level,int xoffset,
int yoffset,int zoffset,sizei width,sizei height,
sizei depth,enum format,enum type,void *data );
void TexSubImage2D(enum target,int level,int xoffset,
int yoffset,sizei width,sizei height,enum format,
enum type,void *data );
void TexSubImage1D(enum target,int level,int xoffset,
sizei width,enum format,enum type,void *data );
void CopyTexSubImage3D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,int yoffset,int zoffset,int x,int y,
sizei width,sizei height );
void CopyTexSubImage2D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,int yoffset,int x,int y,sizei width,
sizei height );
void CopyTexSubImage1D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,int x,int y,sizei width );
respecify only a rectangular subregion of an existing texture array. No change
is made to the internalformat, width, height, depth, or border parameters
of the speci?ed texture array, nor is any change made to texel values out-
side the speci?ed subregion. Currently the target arguments of TexSubIm-
age1D and CopyTexSubImage1D must be TEXTURE 1D, the target arguments
of TexSubImage2D and CopyTexSubImage2D must be one of TEXTURE 2D,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE X,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Y, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Y,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Z, orTEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Z, and the
target arguments of TexSubImage3D and CopyTexSubImage3D must be
TEXTURE 3D. The level parameter of each command speci?es the level of the tex-
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 161
ture array that is modi?ed. If level is less than zero or greater than the base 2 log-
arithm of the maximum texture width, height, or depth, the errorINVALID VALUE
is generated.
TexSubImage3D arguments width, height, depth, format, type, and data match
the corresponding arguments to TexImage3D, meaning that they are speci?ed us-
ing the same values, and have the same meanings. Likewise, TexSubImage2D
arguments width, height, format, type, and data match the corresponding argu-
ments to TexImage2D, and TexSubImage1D arguments width, format, type, and
data match the corresponding arguments to TexImage1D.
CopyTexSubImage3D and CopyTexSubImage2D arguments x, y, width,
2
and height match the corresponding arguments to CopyTexImage2D . CopyTex-
SubImage1D arguments x, y, and width match the corresponding arguments to
CopyTexImage1D. Each of the TexSubImage commands interprets and processes
pixel groups in exactly the manner of its TexImage counterpart, except that the as-
signment of R, G, B, A, and depth pixel group values to the texture components
is controlled by the internalformat of the texture array, not by an argument to the
command. The same constraints and errors apply to the TexSubImage commands’
argument format and the internalformat of the texture array being respeci?ed as
apply to the format and internalformat arguments of its TexImage counterparts.
Arguments xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset of TexSubImage3D and CopyTex-
SubImage3D specify the lower left texel coordinates of a width-wide by height-
high by depth-deep rectangular subregion of the texture array. The depth argument
associated with CopyTexSubImage3D is always 1, because framebuffer memory
is two-dimensional - only a portion of a single s,t slice of a three-dimensional
texture is replaced by CopyTexSubImage3D.
Negative values of xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset correspond to the coordinates
of border texels, addressed as in ?gure 3.10. Taking w , h , d , and b to be the
s s s s
speci?ed width, height, depth, and border width of the texture array, and takingx,
y,z,w,h, andd to be the xoffset, yoffset, zoffset, width, height, and depth argument

Texture images with compressed internal formats may be stored in such a way
that it is not possible to modify an image with subimage commands without having
to decompress and recompress the texture image. Even if the image were modi-
?ed in this manner, it may not be possible to preserve the contents of some of
the texels outside the region being modi?ed. To avoid these complications, the
GL does not support arbitrary modi?cations to texture images with compressed
internal formats. Calling TexSubImage3D, CopyTexSubImage3D, TexSubIm-
age2D, CopyTexSubImage2D, TexSubImage1D, or CopyTexSubImage1D will
result in anINVALID OPERATION error if xoffset, yoffset, or zoffset is not equal to
? b (border width). In addition, the contents of any texel outside the region mod-
s
i?ed by such a call are unde?ned. These restrictions may be relaxed for speci?c
compressed internal formats whose images are easily modi?ed.
3.8.3 Compressed Texture Images
Texture images may also be speci?ed or modi?ed using image data already stored
in a known compressed image format. The GL currently de?nes no such formats,
but provides mechanisms for GL extensions that do.
The commands
void CompressedTexImage1D(enum target,int level,
enum internalformat,sizei width,int border,
sizei imageSize,void *data );
void CompressedTexImage2D(enum target,int level,
enum internalformat,sizei width,sizei height,
int border,sizei imageSize,void *data );
void CompressedTexImage3D(enum target,int level,
enum internalformat,sizei width,sizei height,
sizei depth,int border,sizei imageSize,void *data );
de?ne one-, two-, and three-dimensional texture images, respectively, with incom-
ing data stored in a speci?c compressed image format. The target, level, internal-
format, width, height, depth, and border parameters have the same meaning as in
TexImage1D, TexImage2D, and TexImage3D. data points to compressed image
data stored in the compressed image format corresponding to internalformat. Since
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 164
the GL provides no speci?c image formats, using any of the six generic compressed
internal formats as internalformat will result in anINVALID ENUM error.
For all other compressed internal formats, the compressed image will be de-
coded according to the speci?cation de?ning the internalformat token. Com-
pressed texture images are treated as an array of imageSizeubytes beginning at
address data. All pixel storage and pixel transfer modes are ignored when decoding
a compressed texture image. If the imageSize parameter is not consistent with the
format, dimensions, and contents of the compressed image, an INVALID VALUE
error results. If the compressed image is not encoded according to the de?ned
image format, the results of the call are unde?ned.
Speci?c compressed internal formats may impose format-speci?c restrictions
on the use of the compressed image speci?cation calls or parameters. For example,
the compressed image format might be supported only for 2D textures, or might
not allow non-zero border values. Any such restrictions will be documented in the
extension speci?cation de?ning the compressed internal format; violating these
restrictions will result in anINVALID OPERATION error.
Any restrictions imposed by speci?c compressed internal formats will be
invariant, meaning that if the GL accepts and stores a texture image in
compressed form, providing the same image to CompressedTexImage1D,
CompressedTexImage2D, or CompressedTexImage3D will not result in an
INVALID OPERATION error if the following restrictions are satis?ed:
• data points to a compressed texture image returned by GetCompressedTex-
Image (section 6.1.4).
• target, level, and internalformat match the target, level and format parame-
ters provided to the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.
• width, height, depth, border, internalformat, and image-
Size match the values of TEXTURE WIDTH, TEXTURE HEIGHT,
TEXTURE DEPTH, TEXTURE BORDER, TEXTURE INTERNAL FORMAT,
and TEXTURE COMPRESSED IMAGE SIZE for image level level in effect at
the time of the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.
This guarantee applies not just to images returned by GetCompressedTexImage,
but also to any other properly encoded compressed texture image of the same size
and format.
The commands
void CompressedTexSubImage1D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,sizei width,enum format,sizei imageSize,
void *data );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 165
void CompressedTexSubImage2D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,int yoffset,sizei width,sizei height,
enum format,sizei imageSize,void *data );
void CompressedTexSubImage3D(enum target,int level,
int xoffset,int yoffset,int zoffset,sizei width,
sizei height,sizei depth,enum format,
sizei imageSize,void *data );
respecify only a rectangular region of an existing texture array, with incoming data
stored in a known compressed image format. The target, level, xoffset, yoffset, zoff-
set, width, height, and depth parameters have the same meaning as in TexSubIm-
age1D, TexSubImage2D, and TexSubImage3D. data points to compressed im-
age data stored in the compressed image format corresponding to format. Since
the core GL provides no speci?c image formats, using any of these six generic
compressed internal formats as format will result in anINVALID ENUM error.
The image pointed to by data and the imageSize parameter are interpreted
as though they were provided to CompressedTexImage1D, CompressedTexIm-
age2D, and CompressedTexImage3D. These commands do not provide for im-
age format conversion, so an INVALID OPERATION error results if format does
not match the internal format of the texture image being modi?ed. If the image-
Size parameter is not consistent with the format, dimensions, and contents of the
compressed image (too little or too much data), anINVALID VALUE error results.
As with CompressedTexImage calls, compressed internal formats may have
additional restrictions on the use of the compressed image speci?cation calls or
parameters. Any such restrictions will be documented in the speci?cation de?n-
ing the compressed internal format; violating these restrictions will result in an
INVALID OPERATION error.
Any restrictions imposed by speci?c compressed internal formats will be
invariant, meaning that if the GL accepts and stores a texture image in com-
pressed form, providing the same image to CompressedTexSubImage1D, Com-
pressedTexSubImage2D, CompressedTexSubImage3D will not result in an
INVALID OPERATION error if the following restrictions are satis?ed:
• data points to a compressed texture image returned by GetCompressedTex-
Image (section 6.1.4).
• target, level, and format match the target, level and format parameters pro-
vided to the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.
• width, height, depth, format, and imageSize match the val-
ues of TEXTURE WIDTH, TEXTURE HEIGHT, TEXTURE DEPTH,
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 166
TEXTURE INTERNAL FORMAT, and TEXTURE COMPRESSED IMAGE SIZE
for image level level in effect at the time of the GetCompressedTexImage
call returning data.
• width, height, depth, format match the values of TEXTURE WIDTH,
TEXTURE HEIGHT, TEXTURE DEPTH, and TEXTURE INTERNAL FORMAT
currently in effect for image level level.
• xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset are all ? b, where b is the value of
TEXTURE BORDER currently in effect for image level level.
This guarantee applies not just to images returned by GetCompressedTexIm-
age, but also to any other properly encoded compressed texture image of the same
size.
Calling CompressedTexSubImage3D, CompressedTexSubImage2D, or
CompressedTexSubImage1D will result in anINVALID OPERATION error if xoff-
set, yoffset, or zoffset is not equal to? b (border width), or if width, height,
s
and depth do not match the values of TEXTURE WIDTH, TEXTURE HEIGHT, or
TEXTURE DEPTH, respectively. The contents of any texel outside the region modi-
?ed by the call are unde?ned. These restrictions may be relaxed for speci?c com-
pressed internal formats whose images are easily modi?ed.
3.8.4 Texture Parameters
Various parameters control how the texture array is treated when speci?ed or
changed, and when applied to a fragment. Each parameter is set by calling
void TexParameter{if}(enum target,enum pname,T param );
void TexParameter{if}v(enum target,enum pname,
T params );
target is the target, either TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, or
TEXTURE CUBE MAP. pname is a symbolic constant indicating the parameter to
be set; the possible constants and corresponding parameters are summarized in ta-
ble 3.19. In the ?rst form of the command, param is a value to which to set a
single-valued parameter; in the second form of the command, params is an array
of parameters whose type depends on the parameter being set. If the values for
TEXTURE BORDER COLOR, or the value for TEXTURE PRIORITY are speci?ed as
integers, the conversion for signed integers from table 2.9 is applied to convert
these values to ?oating-point, followed by clamping each value to lie in[0,1].

Texture parameters for a cube map texture apply to the cube map as a whole;
the six distinct two-dimensional texture images use the texture parameters of the
cube map itself.
If the value of texture parameter GENERATE MIPMAP is TRUE, specifying or
changing texture arrays may have side effects, which are discussed in the Auto-
matic Mipmap Generation discussion of section 3.8.8.
3.8.5 Depth Component Textures
Depth textures can be treated asLUMINANCE,INTENSITY orALPHA textures dur-
ing texture ?ltering and application. The initial state for depth textures treats them
asLUMINANCE textures.
3.8.6 Cube Map Texture Selection
When cube map texturing is enabled, the(s t r) texture coordinates are treated
as a direction vector (r r r ) emanating from the center of a cube (the q
x y z
coordinate can be ignored, since it merely scales the vector without affecting the
direction.) At texture application time, the interpolated per-fragment direction vec-
tor selects one of the cube map face’s two-dimensional images based on the largest
magnitude coordinate direction (the major axis direction). If two or more coor-
dinates have the identical magnitude, the implementation may de?ne the rule to
disambiguate this situation. The rule must be deterministic and depend only on
(r r r ). The target column in table 3.20 explains how the major axis direc-
x y z
tion maps to the two-dimensional image of a particular cube map target.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 169

 

This new (s t) is used to ?nd a texture value in the determined face’s two-
dimensional texture image using the rules given in sections 3.8.7 through 3.8.9.
3.8.7 Texture Wrap Modes
Wrap modes de?ned by the values of TEXTURE WRAP S, TEXTURE WRAP T, or
TEXTURE WRAP R respectively affect the interpretation of s, t, and r texture co-
ordinates. The effect of each mode is described below.
Wrap ModeREPEAT
Wrap modeREPEAT ignores the integer part of texture coordinates, using only the
fractional part. (For a number f, the fractional part is f?b fc, regardless of the
sign off; recall that thebc function truncates towards?? .)
REPEAT is the default behavior for all texture coordinates.
Wrap ModeCLAMP
Wrap modeCLAMP clamps texture coordinates to range[0,1].
Wrap ModeCLAMP TO EDGE
Wrap modeCLAMP TO EDGE clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels such
that the texture ?lter never samples a border texel. The color returned when clamp-
ing is derived only from texels at the edge of the texture image.
Texture coordinates are clamped to the range[min,max]. The minimum value
is de?ned as
1
min =
2N
where N is the size of the one-, two-, or three-dimensional texture image in the
direction of clamping. The maximum value is de?ned as
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 170
max = 1? min
so that clamping is always symmetric about the [0,1] mapped range of a texture
coordinate.
Wrap ModeCLAMP TO BORDER
Wrap mode CLAMP TO BORDER clamps texture coordinates at all mipmaps such
that the texture ?lter always samples border texels for fragments whose correspond-
ing texture coordinate is suf?ciently far outside the range[0,1]. The color returned
when clamping is derived only from the border texels of the texture image, or from
the constant border color if the texture image does not have a border.
Texture coordinates are clamped to the range[min,max]. The minimum value
is de?ned as
? 1
min =
2N
whereN is the size (not including borders) of the one-, two-, or three-dimensional
texture image in the direction of clamping. The maximum value is de?ned as
max = 1? min
so that clamping is always symmetric about the [0,1] mapped range of a texture
coordinate.
Wrap ModeMIRRORED REPEAT
Wrap modeMIRRORED REPEAT ?rst mirrors the texture coordinate, where mirror-
ing a valuef computes
(
f?b fc, bfciseven
mirror(f) =
1? (f?b fc), bfcisodd
The mirrored coordinate is then clamped as described above for wrap mode
CLAMP TO EDGE.
3.8.8 Texture Minification
Applying a texture to a primitive implies a mapping from texture image space to
framebuffer image space. In general, this mapping involves a reconstruction of
the sampled texture image, followed by a homogeneous warping implied by the
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 171
mapping to framebuffer space, then a ?ltering, followed ?nally by a resampling
of the ?ltered, warped, reconstructed image before applying it to a fragment. In
the GL this mapping is approximated by one of two simple ?ltering schemes. One
of these schemes is selected based on whether the mapping from texture space to
framebuffer space is deemed to magnify or minify the texture image.
Scale Factor and Level of Detail
The choice is governed by a scale factor ? (x,y) and the level-of-detail parameter
? (x,y), de?ned as
? (x,y) = log [? (x,y)] (3.18)

bias is the value of TEXTURE LOD BIAS for the bound texture object (as
texobj
described in section 3.8.4). bias is the value ofTEXTURE LOD BIAS for the
texunit
current texture unit (as described in section 3.8.13). bias is the value of
shader
the optional bias parameter in the texture lookup functions available to fragment
shaders. If the texture access is performed in a fragment shader without a provided
bias, or outside a fragment shader, thenbias is zero. The sum of these values
shader
is clamped to the range [? bias ,bias ] where bias is the value of the
max max max
implementation de?ned constantMAX TEXTURE LOD BIAS.
If ? (x,y) is less than or equal to the constant c (described below in sec-
tion 3.8.9) the texture is said to be magni?ed; if it is greater, the texture is mini?ed.
The initial values of lod and lod are chosen so as to never clamp the
min max
normal range of? . They may be respeci?ed for a speci?c texture by calling Tex-
Parameter[if] with pname set to TEXTURE MIN LOD or TEXTURE MAX LOD re-
spectively.

While it is generally agreed that equations 3.21 and 3.22 give the best results
when texturing, they are often impractical to implement. Therefore, an imple-
mentation may approximate the ideal ? with a function f(x,y) subject to these
conditions:
1. f(x,y) is continuous and monotonically increasing in each of|?u/?x|,
|?u/?y|,|?v/?x|,|?v/?y|,|?w/?x|, and|?w/?y|

When ? indicates mini?cation, the value assigned to TEXTURE MIN FILTER
is used to determine how the texture value for a fragment is selected. When
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 173
TEXTURE MIN FILTER isNEAREST, the texel in the image array of levellevel
base
that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to that speci?ed by(s,t,r) is obtained. This
means the texel at location(i,j,k) becomes the texture value, withi given by
(
buc, s< 1
i = (3.23)
w ? 1, s = 1
t
(Recall that ifTEXTURE WRAP S isREPEAT, then0? s< 1.) Similarly,j is found
as
(
bvc, t< 1
j = (3.24)
h ? 1, t = 1
t
andk is found as
(
bwc, r < 1
k = (3.25)
d ? 1, r = 1
t
For a one-dimensional texture, j and k are irrelevant; the texel at location i be-
comes the texture value. For a two-dimensional texture,k is irrelevant; the texel at
location(i,j) becomes the texture value.
When TEXTURE MIN FILTER is LINEAR, a 2? 2? 2 cube of texels in the
image array of levellevel is selected. This cube is obtained by ?rst wrapping
base
texture coordinates as described in section 3.8.7, then computing

then the border values de?ned byTEXTURE BORDER COLOR are used instead of the
unspeci?ed value or values. If the texture contains color components, the values of
TEXTURE BORDER COLOR are interpreted as an RGBA color to match the texture’s
internal format in a manner consistent with table 3.15. If the texture contains depth
components, the ?rst component of TEXTURE BORDER COLOR is interpreted as a
depth value.

Mipmapping
TEXTURE MIN FILTER values NEAREST MIPMAP NEAREST,
NEAREST MIPMAP LINEAR, LINEAR MIPMAP NEAREST,
and LINEAR MIPMAP LINEAR each require the use of a mipmap. A mipmap is
an ordered set of arrays representing the same image; each array has a resolution
lower than the previous one. If the image array of levellevel , excluding its
base
border, has dimensionsw ? h ? d , then there areblog (max(w ,h ,d ))c+1

image arrays in the mipmap. Numbering the levels such that levellevel is the
base
0th level, theith array has dimensions
w h d
b b b
max(1,b c)? max(1,b c)? max(1,b c)
i i i

until the last array is reached with dimension1? 1? 1.
Each array in a mipmap is de?ned using TexImage3D, TexImage2D, Copy-
TexImage2D, TexImage1D, or CopyTexImage1D; the array being set is indicated
with the level-of-detail argument level. Level-of-detail numbers proceed from
level for the original texture array through p = blog (max(w ,h ,d ))c +
base b b b

level with each unit increase indicating an array of half the dimensions of the
base
previous one (rounded down to the next integer if fractional) as already described.
All arrays fromlevel throughq = min{p,level } must be de?ned, as dis-
max
base
cussed in section 3.8.10.
The values of level and level may be respeci?ed for a speci?c tex-
max
base
ture by calling TexParameter[if] with pname set to TEXTURE BASE LEVEL or
TEXTURE MAX LEVEL respectively.
The errorINVALID VALUE is generated if either value is negative.
The mipmap is used in conjunction with the level of detail to approximate the
application of an appropriately ?ltered texture to a fragment. Let c be the value
of ? at which the transition from mini?cation to magni?cation occurs (since this
discussion pertains to mini?cation, we are concerned only with values of? where
?>c ).
For mipmap ?lters NEAREST MIPMAP NEAREST and
LINEAR MIPMAP NEAREST, thedth mipmap array is selected, where

Automatic Mipmap Generation
If the value of texture parameterGENERATE MIPMAP isTRUE, making any change
to the interior or border texels of thelevel array of a mipmap will also compute
base
a complete set of mipmap arrays (as de?ned in section 3.8.10) derived from the
modi?ed level array. Array levels level + 1 through p are replaced with
base base
the derived arrays, regardless of their previous contents. All other mipmap arrays,
including thelevel array, are left unchanged by this computation.
base
The internal formats and border widths of the derived mipmap arrays all match
those of the level array, and the dimensions of the derived arrays follow the
base
requirements described in section 3.8.10.
The contents of the derived arrays are computed by repeated, ?ltered reduction
of thelevel array. No particular ?lter algorithm is required, though a box ?lter
base
is recommended as the default ?lter. In some implementations, ?lter quality may
be affected by hints (section 5.6).
Automatic mipmap generation is available only for non-proxy texture image
targets.
3.8.9 Texture Magnification
When ? indicates magni?cation, the value assigned to TEXTURE MAG FILTER
determines how the texture value is obtained. There are two possible values
for TEXTURE MAG FILTER: NEAREST and LINEAR. NEAREST behaves exactly as
NEAREST for TEXTURE MIN FILTER (equations 3.23, 3.24, and 3.25 are used);
LINEAR behaves exactly as LINEAR for TEXTURE MIN FILTER (equation 3.26 is
used). The level-of-detaillevel texture array is always used for magni?cation.
base
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 177
Finally, there is the choice of c, the mini?cation vs. magni?cation switch-
over point. If the magni?cation ?lter is given by LINEAR and the mini?cation
?lter is given byNEAREST MIPMAP NEAREST orNEAREST MIPMAP LINEAR, then
c = 0.5. This is done to ensure that a mini?ed texture does not appear “sharper”
than a magni?ed texture. Otherwisec = 0.
3.8.10 Texture Completeness
A texture is said to be complete if all the image arrays and texture parameters
required to utilize the texture for texture application is consistently de?ned. The
de?nition of completeness varies depending on the texture dimensionality.
For one-, two-, or three-dimensional textures, a texture is complete if the fol-
lowing conditions all hold true:
• The set of mipmap arrays level through q (where q is de?ned in the
base
Mipmapping discussion of section 3.8.8) were each speci?ed with the same
internal format.
• The border widths of each array are the same.
• The dimensions of the arrays follow the sequence described in the Mipmap-
ping discussion of section 3.8.8.
• level ? level
base max
• Each dimension of thelevel array is positive.
base
Array levelsk wherek < level ork > q are insigni?cant to the de?nition of
base
completeness.
For cube map textures, a texture is cube complete if the following conditions
all hold true:
• The level arrays of each of the six texture images making up the cube
base
map have identical, positive, and square dimensions.
• Thelevel arrays were each speci?ed with the same internal format.
base
• Thelevel arrays each have the same border width.
base
Finally, a cube map texture is mipmap cube complete if, in addition to being
cube complete, each of the six texture images considered individually is complete.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 178
Effects of Completeness on Texture Application
If one-, two-, or three-dimensional texturing (but not cube map textur-
ing) is enabled for a texture unit at the time a primitive is rasterized, if
TEXTURE MIN FILTER is one that requires a mipmap, and if the texture image
bound to the enabled texture target is not complete, then it is as if texture mapping
were disabled for that texture unit.
If cube map texturing is enabled for a texture unit at the time a primitive
is rasterized, and if the bound cube map texture is not cube complete, then it
is as if texture mapping were disabled for that texture unit. Additionally, if
TEXTURE MIN FILTER is one that requires a mipmap, and if the texture is not
mipmap cube complete, then it is as if texture mapping were disabled for that tex-
ture unit.
Effects of Completeness on Texture Image Specification
An implementation may allow a texture image array of level 1 or greater to be cre-
ated only if a mipmap complete set of image arrays consistent with the requested
array can be supported. A mipmap complete set of arrays is equivalent to a com-
plete set of arrays wherelevel = 0 andlevel = 1000, and where, excluding
base max
borders, the dimensions of the image array being created are understood to be half
the corresponding dimensions of the next lower numbered array (rounded down
to the next integer if fractional).
3.8.11 Texture State and Proxy State
The state necessary for texture can be divided into two categories. First, there are
the nine sets of mipmap arrays (one each for the one-, two-, and three-dimensional
texture targets and six for the cube map texture targets) and their number. Each
array has associated with it a width, height (two- and three-dimensional and cube
map only), and depth (three-dimensional only), a border width, an integer de-
scribing the internal format of the image, six integer values describing the res-
olutions of each of the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and intensity com-
ponents of the image, a boolean describing whether the image is compressed or
not, and an integer size of a compressed image. Each initial texture array is
null (zero width, height, and depth, zero border width, internal format 1, with
the compressed ?ag set to FALSE, a zero compressed size, and zero-sized com-
ponents). Next, there are the two sets of texture properties; each consists of
the selected mini?cation and magni?cation ?lters, the wrap modes for s, t (two-
and three-dimensional and cube map only), and r (three-dimensional only), the
TEXTURE BORDER COLOR, two integers describing the minimum and maximum
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 179
level of detail, two integers describing the base and maximum mipmap array,
a boolean ?ag indicating whether the texture is resident, a boolean indicating
whether automatic mipmap generation should be performed, three integers de-
scribing the depth texture mode, compare mode, and compare function, and the
priority associated with each set of properties. The value of the resident ?ag is
determined by the GL and may change as a result of other GL operations. The ?ag
may only be queried, not set, by applications (see section 3.8.12). In the initial
state, the value assigned toTEXTURE MIN FILTER isNEAREST MIPMAP LINEAR,
and the value for TEXTURE MAG FILTER is LINEAR. s, t, and r wrap modes
are all set to REPEAT. The values of TEXTURE MIN LOD and TEXTURE MAX LOD
are -1000 and 1000 respectively. The values of TEXTURE BASE LEVEL and
TEXTURE MAX LEVEL are 0 and 1000 respectively. TEXTURE PRIORITY is 1.0,
and TEXTURE BORDER COLOR is (0,0,0,0). The value of GENERATE MIPMAP
is false. The values of DEPTH TEXTURE MODE, TEXTURE COMPARE MODE, and
TEXTURE COMPARE FUNC are LUMINANCE, NONE, and LEQUAL respectively. The
initial value ofTEXTURE RESIDENT is determined by the GL.
In addition to the one-, two-, and three-dimensional and the six cube map sets
of image arrays, the partially instantiated one-, two-, and three-dimensional and
one cube map set of proxy image arrays are maintained. Each proxy array includes
width, height (two- and three-dimensional arrays only), depth (three-dimensional
arrays only), border width, and internal format state values, as well as state for
the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and intensity component resolutions. Proxy
arrays do not include image data, nor do they include texture properties. When
TexImage3D is executed with target speci?ed as PROXY TEXTURE 3D, the three-
dimensional proxy state values of the speci?ed level-of-detail are recomputed and
updated. If the image array would not be supported by TexImage3D called with
target set toTEXTURE 3D, no error is generated, but the proxy width, height, depth,
border width, and component resolutions are set to zero. If the image array would
be supported by such a call to TexImage3D, the proxy state values are set exactly
as though the actual image array were being speci?ed. No pixel data are transferred
or processed in either case.
One- and two-dimensional proxy arrays are operated on in the same way when
TexImage1D is executed with target speci?ed asPROXY TEXTURE 1D, or TexIm-
age2D is executed with target speci?ed asPROXY TEXTURE 2D.
The cube map proxy arrays are operated on in the same manner when TexIm-
age2D is executed with the target ?eld speci?ed as PROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP,
with the addition that determining that a given cube map texture is supported with
PROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP indicates that all six of the cube map 2D images are
supported. Likewise, if the speci?edPROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP is not supported,
none of the six cube map 2D images are supported.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 180
There is no image associated with any of the proxy textures. There-
fore PROXY TEXTURE 1D, PROXY TEXTURE 2D, and PROXY TEXTURE 3D, and
PROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP cannot be used as textures, and their images must
never be queried using GetTexImage. The error INVALID ENUM is generated if
this is attempted. Likewise, there is no non level-related state associated with a
proxy texture, and GetTexParameteriv or GetTexParameterfv may not be called
with a proxy texture target. The error INVALID ENUM is generated if this is at-
tempted.
3.8.12 Texture Objects
In addition to the default textures TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, and
TEXTURE CUBE MAP, named one-, two-, and three-dimensional and cube map tex-
ture objects can be created and operated upon. The name space for texture objects
is the unsigned integers, with zero reserved by the GL.
A texture object is created by binding an unused name to TEXTURE 1D,
TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, or TEXTURE CUBE MAP. The binding is effected by
calling
void BindTexture(enum target,uint texture );
with target set to the desired texture target and texture set to the unused name.
The resulting texture object is a new state vector, comprising all the state values
listed in section 3.8.11, set to the same initial values. If the new texture object is
bound to TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, or TEXTURE CUBE MAP, it is
and remains a one-, two-, three-dimensional, or cube map texture respectively until
it is deleted.
BindTexture may also be used to bind an existing texture object to ei-
therTEXTURE 1D,TEXTURE 2D,TEXTURE 3D, orTEXTURE CUBE MAP. The error
INVALID OPERATION is generated if an attempt is made to bind a texture object
of different dimensionality than the speci?ed target. If the bind is successful no
change is made to the state of the bound texture object, and any previous binding
to target is broken.
While a texture object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is
bound affect the bound object, and queries of the target to which it is bound return
state from the bound object. If texture mapping of the dimensionality of the target
to which a texture object is bound is enabled, the state of the bound texture object
directs the texturing operation.
In the initial state, TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D,
and TEXTURE CUBE MAP have one-, two-, three-dimensional, and cube map tex-
ture state vectors respectively associated with them. In order that access to these
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 181
initial textures not be lost, they are treated as texture objects all of whose names
are 0. The initial one-, two-, three-dimensional, and cube map texture is therefore
operated upon, queried, and applied asTEXTURE 1D,TEXTURE 2D,TEXTURE 3D,
orTEXTURE CUBE MAP respectively while 0 is bound to the corresponding targets.
Texture objects are deleted by calling
void DeleteTextures(sizei n,uint *textures );
textures contains n names of texture objects to be deleted. After a texture object
is deleted, it has no contents or dimensionality, and its name is again unused. If
a texture that is currently bound to one of the targets TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D,
TEXTURE 3D, or TEXTURE CUBE MAP is deleted, it is as though BindTexture had
been executed with the same target and texture zero. Unused names in textures are
silently ignored, as is the value zero.
The command
void GenTextures(sizei n,uint *textures );
returns n previously unused texture object names in textures. These names are
marked as used, for the purposes of GenTextures only, but they acquire texture
state and a dimensionality only when they are ?rst bound, just as if they were
unused.
An implementation may choose to establish a working set of texture objects on
which binding operations are performed with higher performance. A texture object
that is currently part of the working set is said to be resident. The command
boolean AreTexturesResident(sizei n,uint *textures,
boolean *residences );
returnsTRUE if all of the n texture objects named in textures are resident, or if the
implementation does not distinguish a working set. If at least one of the texture
objects named in textures is not resident, thenFALSE is returned, and the residence
of each texture object is returned in residences. Otherwise the contents of resi-
dences are not changed. If any of the names in textures are unused or are zero,
FALSE is returned, the errorINVALID VALUE is generated, and the contents of res-
idences are indeterminate. The residence status of a single bound texture object
can also be queried by calling GetTexParameteriv or GetTexParameterfv with
target set to the target to which the texture object is bound, and pname set to
TEXTURE RESIDENT.
AreTexturesResident indicates only whether a texture object is currently resi-
dent, not whether it could not be made resident. An implementation may choose to
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 182
make a texture object resident only on ?rst use, for example. The client may guide
the GL implementation in determining which texture objects should be resident by
specifying a priority for each texture object. The command
void PrioritizeTextures(sizei n,uint *textures,
clampf *priorities );
sets the priorities of the n texture objects named in textures to the values in priori-
ties. Each priority value is clamped to the range [0,1] before it is assigned. Zero in-
dicates the lowest priority, with the least likelihood of being resident. One indicates
the highest priority, with the greatest likelihood of being resident. The priority of a
single bound texture object may also be changed by calling TexParameteri, Tex-
Parameterf, TexParameteriv, or TexParameterfv withtarget set to the target to
which the texture object is bound,pname set toTEXTURE PRIORITY, andparam
orparams specifying the new priority value (which is clamped to the range [0,1]
before being assigned). PrioritizeTextures silently ignores attempts to prioritize
unused texture object names or zero (default textures).
The texture object name space, including the initial one-, two-, and three-
dimensional texture objects, is shared among all texture units. A texture object
may be bound to more than one texture unit simultaneously. After a texture object
is bound, any GL operations on that target object affect any other texture units to
which the same texture object is bound.
Texture binding is affected by the setting of the stateACTIVE TEXTURE.
If a texture object is deleted, it as if all texture units which are bound to that
texture object are rebound to texture object zero.
3.8.13 Texture Environments and Texture Functions
The command
void TexEnv{if}(enum target,enum pname,T param );
void TexEnv{if}v(enum target,enum pname,T params );
sets parameters of the texture environment that speci?es how texture values are
interpreted when texturing a fragment, or sets per-texture-unit ?ltering parameters.
target must be one of POINT SPRITE, TEXTURE ENV or
TEXTURE FILTER CONTROL. pname is a symbolic constant indicating the
parameter to be set. In the ?rst form of the command, param is a value to which to
set a single-valued parameter; in the second form, params is a pointer to an array
of parameters: either a single symbolic constant or a value or group of values to
which the parameter should be set.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.8. TEXTURING 183
When target is POINT SPRITE, point sprite rasterization behavior is affected
as described in section 3.3.
When target is TEXTURE FILTER CONTROL, pname must be
TEXTURE LOD BIAS. In this case the parameter is a single signed ?oating
point value,bias , that biases the level of detail parameter? as described in
texunit
section 3.8.8.
When target is TEXTURE ENV, the possible environment parame-
ters are TEXTURE ENV MODE, TEXTURE ENV COLOR, COMBINE RGB, and
COMBINE ALPHA. TEXTURE ENV MODE may be set to one of REPLACE,
MODULATE, DECAL, BLEND, ADD, or COMBINE. TEXTURE ENV COLOR is set
to an RGBA color by providing four single-precision ?oating-point values in the
range [0,1] (values outside this range are clamped to it). If integers are provided
forTEXTURE ENV COLOR, then they are converted to ?oating-point as speci?ed in
table 2.9 for signed integers.
The value of TEXTURE ENV MODE speci?es a texture function. The result of
this function depends on the fragment and the texture array value. The precise
form of the function depends on the base internal formats of the texture arrays that
were last speci?ed.

C and A are the primary color components of the incoming fragment; C

and A are the components of the texture source color, derived from the ?ltered

texture values R , G , B , A , L , and I as shown in table 3.21; C and A are

the components of the texture environment color; C and A are the components

resulting from the previous texture environment (for texture environment 0,C and

components computed by the texture function.
All of these color values are in the range[0,1]. The texture functions are spec-
i?ed in tables 3.22, 3.23, and 3.24.
If the value of TEXTURE ENV MODE isCOMBINE, the form of the texture func-
tion depends on the values of COMBINE RGB and COMBINE ALPHA, according to
table 3.24. The RGB and ALPHA results of the texture function are then multi-
plied by the values ofRGB SCALE andALPHA SCALE, respectively. The results are
clamped to[0,1].
The arguments Arg0, Arg1, and Arg2 are determined by the values of
SRCn RGB, SRCn ALPHA, OPERANDn RGB and OPERANDn ALPHA, where n = 0,

DEPTH TEXTURE MODE.
Depth Texture Comparison Mode
If the currently bound texture’s base internal format is DEPTH COMPONENT, then
TEXTURE COMPARE MODE,TEXTURE COMPARE FUNC andDEPTH TEXTURE MODE
control the output of the texture unit as described below. Otherwise, the texture
unit operates in the normal manner and texture comparison is bypassed.
LetD be the depth texture value, in the range[0,1], andR be the interpolated
t
texture coordinate clamped to the range [0,1]. Then the effective texture valueL ,
t
I , orA is computed as follows:

If the value of TEXTURE MAG FILTER is not NEAREST, or the value of
TEXTURE MIN FILTER is not NEAREST or NEAREST MIPMAP NEAREST, then r
may be computed by comparing more than one depth texture value to the texture
R coordinate. The details of this are implementation-dependent, butr should be a
value in the range [0,1] which is proportional to the number of comparison passes
or failures.
3.8.15 Texture Application
Texturing is enabled or disabled using the generic Enable and Disable com-
mands, respectively, with the symbolic constants TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D,
TEXTURE 3D, orTEXTURE CUBE MAP to enable the one-, two-, three-dimensional,
or cube map texture, respectively. If both two- and one-dimensional textures are
enabled, the two-dimensional texture is used. If the three-dimensional and either
of the two- or one-dimensional textures is enabled, the three-dimensional texture
is used. If the cube map texture and any of the three-, two-, or one-dimensional
textures is enabled, then cube map texturing is used. If all texturing is disabled, a
rasterized fragment is passed on unaltered to the next stage of the GL (although its
texture coordinates may be discarded). Otherwise, a texture value is found accord-
ing to the parameter values of the currently bound texture image of the appropriate
dimensionality using the rules given in sections 3.8.6 through 3.8.9. This texture
value is used along with the incoming fragment in computing the texture function
indicated by the currently bound texture environment. The result of this function
replaces the incoming fragment’s primary R, G, B, and A values. These are the
color values passed to subsequent operations. Other data associated with the in-
coming fragment remain unchanged, except that the texture coordinates may be
discarded.
Each texture unit is enabled and bound to texture objects independently from
the other texture units. Each texture unit follows the precedence rules for one-, two-
, three-dimensional, and cube map textures. Thus texture units can be performing
texture mapping of different dimensionalities simultaneously. Each unit has its
own enable and binding states.
Each texture unit is paired with an environment function, as shown in ?g-
ure 3.11. The second texture function is computed using the texture value from
the second texture, the fragment resulting from the ?rst texture function computa-
tion and the second texture unit’s environment function. If there is a third texture,
the fragment resulting from the second texture function is combined with the third
texture value using the third texture unit’s environment function and so on. The tex-
ture unit selected by ActiveTexture determines which texture unit’s environment
is modi?ed by TexEnv calls.

Figure 3.11. Multitexture pipeline. Four texture units are shown; however, multi-
texturing may support a different number of units depending on the implementation.
The input fragment color is successively combined with each texture according to
the state of the corresponding texture environment, and the resulting fragment color
passed as input to the next texture unit in the pipeline.
If the value ofTEXTURE ENV MODE isCOMBINE, the texture function associated
with a given texture unit is computed using the values speci?ed by SRCn RGB,
SRCn ALPHA,OPERANDn RGB andOPERANDn ALPHA. IfTEXTUREn is speci?ed as
SRCn RGB or SRCn ALPHA, the texture value from texture unit n will be used in
computing the texture function for this texture unit.
Texturing is enabled and disabled individually for each texture unit. If texturing
is disabled for one of the units, then the fragment resulting from the previous unit
is passed unaltered to the following unit. Individual texture units beyond those
speci?ed byMAX TEXTURE UNITS are always treated as disabled.
If a texture unit is disabled or has an invalid or incomplete texture (as de?ned
in section 3.8.10) bound to it, then blending is disabled for that texture unit. If the
texture environment for a given enabled texture unit references a disabled texture
unit, or an invalid or incomplete texture that is bound to another unit, then the
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.9. COLORSUM 191
results of texture blending are unde?ned.
The required state, per texture unit, is four bits indicating whether each of one-,
two-, three-dimensional, or cube map texturing is enabled or disabled. In the intial
state, all texturing is disabled for all texture units.
3.9 Color Sum
At the beginning of color sum, a fragment has two RGBA colors: a primary color
c (which texturing, if enabled, may have modi?ed) and a secondary colorc .
pri sec
If color sum is enabled, the R, G, and B components of these two colors are
summed to produce a single post-texturing RGBA colorc. The A component ofc
is taken from the A component ofc ; the A component ofc is unused. The
pri sec
components ofc are then clamped to the range[0,1]. If color sum is disabled, then
c is assigned toc.
pri
Color sum is enabled or disabled using the generic Enable and Disable com-
mands, respectively, with the symbolic constantCOLOR SUM. If lighting is enabled
and if a vertex shader is not active, the color sum stage is always applied, ignoring
the value ofCOLOR SUM.
The state required is a single bit indicating whether color sum is enabled or
disabled. In the initial state, color sum is disabled.
Color sum has no effect in color index mode, or if a fragment shader is active.
3.10 Fog
If enabled, fog blends a fog color with a rasterized fragment’s post-texturing color
using a blending factorf. Fog is enabled and disabled with the Enable and Disable
commands using the symbolic constantFOG.
This factorf is computed according to one of three equations:
f = exp(? d· c), (3.30)
2
f = exp(? (d· c) ), or (3.31)
e? c
f = (3.32)
e? s
If a vertex shader is active, or if the fog source, as de?ned below, isFOG COORD,
thenc is the interpolated value of the fog coordinate for this fragment. Otherwise,
if the fog source is FRAGMENT DEPTH, then c is the eye-coordinate distance from
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.10. FOG 192
the eye,(0,0,0,1) in eye coordinates, to the fragment center. The equation and the
fog source, along with eitherd ore ands, is speci?ed with
void Fog{if}(enum pname,T param );
void Fog{if}v(enum pname,T params );
If pname is FOG MODE, then param must be, or params must point to an inte-
ger that is one of the symbolic constants EXP, EXP2, or LINEAR, in which case
equation 3.30, 3.31, or 3.32, respectively, is selected for the fog calculation (if,
when 3.32 is selected,e = s, results are unde?ned). If pname isFOG COORD SRC,
then param must be, or params must point to an integer that is one of the sym-
bolic constants FRAGMENT DEPTH or FOG COORD. If pname is FOG DENSITY,
FOG START, or FOG END, then param is or params points to a value that is d, s,
or e, respectively. If d is speci?ed less than zero, the error INVALID VALUE re-
sults.
An implementation may choose to approximate the eye-coordinate distance
from the eye to each fragment center by|z|. Further, f need not be computed at
e
each fragment, but may be computed at each vertex and interpolated as other data
are.
No matter which equation and approximation is used to computef, the result
is clamped to[0,1] to obtain the ?nalf.
f is used differently depending on whether the GL is in RGBA or color index
mode. In RGBA mode, ifC represents a rasterized fragment’s R, G, or B value,
r
then the corresponding value produced by fog is
C =fC +(1? f)C .
r f
(The rasterized fragment’s A value is not changed by fog blending.) The R, G, B,
and A values ofC are speci?ed by calling Fog with pname equal toFOG COLOR;
f
in this case params points to four values comprisingC . If these are not ?oating-
f
point values, then they are converted to ?oating-point using the conversion given
in table 2.9 for signed integers. Each component of C is clamped to [0,1] when
f
speci?ed.
In color index mode, the formula for fog blending is
I =i +(1? f)i
r f
where i is the rasterized fragment’s color index and i is a single-precision
r f
?oating-point value. (1? f)i is rounded to the nearest ?xed-point value with
f
the same number of bits to the right of the binary point asi , and the integer por-
r
n
tion ofI is masked (bitwise ANDed) with2 ? 1, wheren is the number of bits in
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.11. FRAGMENTSHADERS 193
a color in the color index buffer (buffers are discussed in chapter 4). The value of
i is set by calling Fog with pname set toFOG INDEX and param being or params
f
pointing to a single value for the fog index. The integer part ofi is masked with
f
n
2 ? 1.
The state required for fog consists of a three valued integer to select the fog
equation, three ?oating-point values d, e, and s, an RGBA fog color and a fog
color index, a two-valued integer to select the fog coordinate source, and a single
bit to indicate whether or not fog is enabled. In the initial state, fog is disabled,
FOG COORD SRC is FRAGMENT DEPTH, FOG MODE is EXP, d = 1.0, e = 1.0, and
s = 0.0;C = (0,0,0,0) andi = 0.
f f
Fog has no effect if a fragment shader is active.
3.11 Fragment Shaders
The sequence of operations that are applied to fragments that result from raster-
izing a point, line segment, polygon, pixel rectangle or bitmap as described in
sections 3.8 through 3.10 is a ?xed functionality method for processing such frag-
ments. Applications can more generally describe the operations that occur on such
fragments by using a fragment shader.
A fragment shader is an array of strings containing source code for the opera-
tions that are meant to occur on each fragment that results from rasterizing a point,
line segment, polygon, pixel rectangle or bitmap. The language used for fragment
shaders is described in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
A fragment shader only applies when the GL is in RGBA mode. Its operation
in color index mode is unde?ned.
Fragment shaders are created as described in section 2.15.1 using a type pa-
rameter of FRAGMENT SHADER. They are attached to and used in program objects
as described in section 2.15.2.
When the program object currently in use includes a fragment shader, its frag-
ment shader is considered active, and is used to process fragments. If the program
object has no fragment shader, or no program object is currently in use, the ?xed-
function fragment processing operations described in previous sections are used.
3.11.1 Shader Variables
Fragment shaders can access uniforms belonging to the current shader object. The
amount of storage available for fragment shader uniform variables is speci?ed by
the implementation dependent constant MAX FRAGMENT UNIFORM COMPONENTS.
This value represents the number of individual ?oating-point, integer, or boolean
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.11. FRAGMENTSHADERS 194
values that can be held in uniform variable storage for a fragment shader. A link
error will be generated if an attempt is made to utilize more than the space available
for fragment shader uniform variables.
Fragment shaders can read varying variables that correspond to the attributes
of the fragments produced by rasterization. The OpenGL Shading Language Spec-
i?cation de?nes a set of built-in varying variables that can be be accessed by a
fragment shader. These built-in varying variables include the data associated with
a fragment that are used for ?xed-function fragment processing, such as the frag-
ment’s position, color, secondary color, texture coordinates, fog coordinate, and
eyez coordinate.
Additionally, when a vertex shader is active, it may de?ne one or more varying
variables (see section 2.15.3 and the OpenGL Shading Language Specification).
These values are interpolated across the primitive being rendered. The results of
these interpolations are available when varying variables of the same name are
de?ned in the fragment shader.
User-de?ned varying variables are not saved in the current raster position.
When processing fragments generated by the rasterization of a pixel rectangle or
bitmap, that values of user-de?ned varying variables are unde?ned. Built-in vary-
ing variables have well-de?ned values.
3.11.2 Shader Execution
If a fragment shader is active, the executable version of the fragment shader is used
to process incoming fragment values that are the result of point, line segment, poly-
gon, pixel rectangle or bitmap rasterization rather than the ?xed-function fragment
processing described in sections 3.8 through 3.10. In particular,
• The texture environments and texture functions described in section 3.8.13
are not applied.
• Texture application as described in section 3.8.15 is not applied.
• Color sum as described in section 3.9 is not applied.
• Fog as described in section 3.10 is not applied.
Texture Access
When a texture lookup is performed in a fragment shader, the GL computes the
?ltered texture value ? in the manner described in sections 3.8.8 and 3.8.9, and
converts it to a texture source color C according to table 3.21 (section 3.8.13).

of the OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation.
Texture lookups involving textures with depth component data can either re-
turn the depth data directly or return the results of a comparison with the r tex-
ture coordinate used to perform the lookup. The comparison operation is re-
quested in the shader by using the shadow sampler types (sampler1DShadow
orsampler2DShadow) and in the texture using theTEXTURE COMPARE MODE pa-
rameter. These requests must be consistent; the results of a texture lookup are
unde?ned if:
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of type sampler1D or
sampler2D, and the texture object’s internal format isDEPTH COMPONENT,
and theTEXTURE COMPARE MODE is notNONE.
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of typesampler1DShadow
or sampler2DShadow, and the texture object’s internal format is
DEPTH COMPONENT, and theTEXTURE COMPARE MODE isNONE.
• The sampler used in a texture lookup function is of typesampler1DShadow
or sampler2DShadow, and the texture object’s internal format is not
DEPTH COMPONENT.
If a fragment shader uses a sampler whose associated texture object is not com-
plete, as de?ned in section 3.8.10, the texture image unit will return (R,G,B,A)
=(0,0,0,1).
The number of separate texture units that can be accessed from within a
fragment shader during the rendering of a single primitive is speci?ed by the
implementation- dependent constantMAX TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS.
Shader Inputs
The OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation describes the values that are avail-
able as inputs to the fragment shader.
The built-in variable gl FragCoord holds the window coordinates x, y, z,
1
and for the fragment. The z component of gl FragCoord undergoes an im-
w
plied conversion to ?oating-point. This conversion must leave the values 0 and
1 invariant. Note that this z component already has a polygon offset added in, if
1
enabled (see section 3.5.5. The value is computed from thew coordinate (see
c
w
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.11. FRAGMENTSHADERS 196
section 2.11), which is the result of the product of the projection matrix and the
vertex’s eye coordinates.
The built-in variables gl Color and gl SecondaryColor hold the R, G, B,
and A components, respectively, of the fragment color and secondary color. Each
?xed-point color component undergoes an implied conversion to ?oating-point.
This conversion must leave the values 0 and 1 invariant.
The built-in variablegl FrontFacing is set toTRUE if the fragment is gener-
ated from a front facing primitive, andFALSE otherwise. For fragments generated
from polygon, triangle, or quadrilateral primitives (including ones resulting from
polygons rendered as points or lines), the determination is made by examining the
sign of the area computed by equation 2.6 of section 2.14.1 (including the possible
reversal of this sign controlled by FrontFace). If the sign is positive, fragments
generated by the primitive are front facing; otherwise, they are back facing. All
other fragments are considered front facing.
Shader Outputs
The OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation describes the values that may be
output by a fragment shader. These are gl FragColor, gl FragData[n], and
gl FragDepth. The ?nal fragment color values or the ?nal fragment data values
written by a fragment shader are clamped to the range [0,1] and then converted to
?xed-point as described in section 2.14.9. The ?nal fragment depth written by a
fragment shader is ?rst clamped to [0,1] and then converted to ?xed-point as if it
were a windowz value (see section 2.11.1). Note that the depth range computation
is not applied here, only the conversion to ?xed-point.
Writing to gl FragColor speci?es the fragment color (color number
zero) that will be used by subsequent stages of the pipeline. Writing to
gl FragData[n] speci?es the value of fragment color number n. Any colors,
or color components, associated with a fragment that are not written by the frag-
ment shader are unde?ned. A fragment shader may not statically assign values to
both gl FragColor and gl FragData. In this case, a compile or link error will
result. A shader statically assigns a value to a variable if, after pre-processing, it
contains a statement that would write to the variable, whether or not run-time ?ow
of control will cause that statement to be executed.
Writing to gl FragDepth speci?es the depth value for the fragment being
processed. If the active fragment shader does not statically assign a value to
gl FragDepth, then the depth value generated during rasterization is used by sub-
sequent stages of the pipeline. Otherwise, the value assigned togl FragDepth is
used, and is unde?ned for any fragments where statements assigning a value to
gl FragDepth are not executed. Thus, if a shader statically assigns a value to
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20043.12. ANTIALIASINGAPPLICATION 197
gl FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
3.12 Antialiasing Application
If antialiasing is enabled for the primitive from which a rasterized fragment was
produced, then the computed coverage value is applied to the fragment. In RGBA
mode, the value is multiplied by the fragment’s alpha (A) value to yield a ?nal
alpha value. In color index mode, the value is used to set the low order bits of
the color index value as described in section 3.2. The coverage value is applied
separately to each fragment color.
3.13 Multisample Point Fade
Finally, if multisampling is enabled and the rasterized fragment results from a point
primitive, then the computed fade factor from equation 3.2 is applied to the frag-
ment. In RGBA mode, the fade factor is multiplied by the fragment’s alpha value
to yield a ?nal alpha value. In color index mode, the fade factor has no effect. The
fade factor is applied separately to each fragment color.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Chapter 4
Per-Fragment Operations and the
Framebuffer
The framebuffer consists of a set of pixels arranged as a two-dimensional array.
The height and width of this array may vary from one GL implementation to an-
other. For purposes of this discussion, each pixel in the framebuffer is simply a set
of some number of bits. The number of bits per pixel may also vary depending on
the particular GL implementation or context.
Corresponding bits from each pixel in the framebuffer are grouped together
into a bitplane; each bitplane contains a single bit from each pixel. These bitplanes
are grouped into several logical buffers. These are the color, depth, stencil, and
accumulation buffers. The color buffer actually consists of a number of buffers:
the front left buffer, the front right buffer, the back left buffer, the back right buffer,
and some number of auxiliary buffers. Typically the contents of the front buffers
are displayed on a color monitor while the contents of the back buffers are invisi-
ble. (Monoscopic contexts display only the front left buffer; stereoscopic contexts
display both the front left and the front right buffers.) The contents of the aux-
iliary buffers are never visible. All color buffers must have the same number of
bitplanes, although an implementation or context may choose not to provide right
buffers, back buffers, or auxiliary buffers at all. Further, an implementation or
context may not provide depth, stencil, or accumulation buffers.
Color buffers consist of either unsigned integer color indices or R, G, B, and,
optionally, A unsigned integer values. The number of bitplanes in each of the color
buffers, the depth buffer, the stencil buffer, and the accumulation buffer is ?xed and
window dependent. If an accumulation buffer is provided, it must have at least as
many bitplanes per R, G, and B color component as do the color buffers.
The initial state of all provided bitplanes is unde?ned.

4.1 Per-Fragment Operations
A fragment produced by rasterization with window coordinates of (x ,y ) mod-
w w
i?es the pixel in the framebuffer at that location based on a number of parame-
ters and conditions. We describe these modi?cations and tests, diagrammed in
?gure 4.1, in the order in which they are performed. Figure 4.1 diagrams these
modi?cations and tests.
4.1.1 Pixel Ownership Test
The ?rst test is to determine if the pixel at location (x ,y ) in the framebuffer
w w
is currently owned by the GL (more precisely, by this GL context). If it is not,
the window system decides the fate the incoming fragment. Possible results are
that the fragment is discarded or that some subset of the subsequent per-fragment
operations are applied to the fragment. This test allows the window system to
control the GL’s behavior, for instance, when a GL window is obscured.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 200
4.1.2 Scissor Test
The scissor test determines if (x ,y ) lies within the scissor rectangle de?ned by
w w
four values. These values are set with
void Scissor(int left,int bottom,sizei width,
sizei height );
If left? x < left+ width and bottom? y < bottom+ height, then the scissor
w w
test passes. Otherwise, the test fails and the fragment is discarded. The test is
enabled or disabled using Enable or Disable using the constant SCISSOR TEST.
When disabled, it is as if the scissor test always passes. If either width or height
is less than zero, then the error INVALID VALUE is generated. The state required
consists of four integer values and a bit indicating whether the test is enabled or
disabled. In the initial stateleft =bottom = 0;width andheight are determined
by the size of the GL window. Initially, the scissor test is disabled.
4.1.3 Multisample Fragment Operations
This step modi?es fragment alpha and coverage values based on the values
of SAMPLE ALPHA TO COVERAGE, SAMPLE ALPHA TO ONE, SAMPLE COVERAGE,
SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE, and SAMPLE COVERAGE INVERT. No changes to the
fragment alpha or coverage values are made at this step if MULTISAMPLE is dis-
abled, or if the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is not one.
SAMPLE ALPHA TO COVERAGE, SAMPLE ALPHA TO ONE, and
SAMPLE COVERAGE are enabled and disabled by calling Enable and Disable
with cap speci?ed as one of the three token values. All three values are
queried by calling IsEnabled with cap set to the desired token value. If
SAMPLE ALPHA TO COVERAGE is enabled, a temporary coverage value is gen-
erated where each bit is determined by the alpha value at the corresponding
sample location. The temporary coverage value is then ANDed with the fragment
coverage value. Otherwise the fragment coverage value is unchanged at this point.
If multiple colors are written by a fragment shader, the alpha value of fragment
color zero is used to determine the temporary coverage value.
No speci?c algorithm is required for converting the sample alpha values to a
temporary coverage value. It is intended that the number of 1’s in the temporary
coverage be proportional to the set of alpha values for the fragment, with all 1’s
corresponding to the maximum of all alpha values, and all 0’s corresponding to
all alpha values being 0. It is also intended that the algorithm be pseudo-random
in nature, to avoid image artifacts due to regular coverage sample locations. The
algorithm can and probably should be different at different pixel locations. If it
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 201
does differ, it should be de?ned relative to window, not screen, coordinates, so that
rendering results are invariant with respect to window position.
Next, ifSAMPLE ALPHA TO ONE is enabled, each alpha value is replaced by the
maximum representable alpha value. Otherwise, the alpha values are not changed.
Finally, if SAMPLE COVERAGE is enabled, the fragment coverage is ANDed
with another temporary coverage. This temporary coverage is generated
in the same manner as the one described above, but as a function of
the value of SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE. The function need not be identical,
but it must have the same properties of proportionality and invariance. If
SAMPLE COVERAGE INVERT is TRUE, the temporary coverage is inverted (all bit
values are inverted) before it is ANDed with the fragment coverage.
The values of SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE and SAMPLE COVERAGE INVERT
are speci?ed by calling
void SampleCoverage(clampf value,boolean invert );
with value set to the desired coverage value, and invert set to TRUE or FALSE.
value is clamped to [0,1] before being stored as SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE.
SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE is queried by calling GetFloatv with pname set to
SAMPLE COVERAGE VALUE. SAMPLE COVERAGE INVERT is queried by calling
GetBooleanv with pname set toSAMPLE COVERAGE INVERT.
4.1.4 Alpha Test
This step applies only in RGBA mode. In color index mode, proceed to the next
operation. The alpha test discards a fragment conditional on the outcome of a
comparison between the incoming fragment’s alpha value and a constant value. If
multiple colors are written by a fragment shader, the alpha value of fragment color
zero is used to determine the result of the alpha test. The comparison is enabled
or disabled with the generic Enable and Disable commands using the symbolic
constant ALPHA TEST. When disabled, it is as if the comparison always passes.
The test is controlled with
void AlphaFunc(enum func,clampf ref );
func is a symbolic constant indicating the alpha test function; ref is a reference
value. ref is clamped to lie in [0,1], and then converted to a ?xed-point value ac-
cording to the rules given for an A component in section 2.14.9. For purposes
of the alpha test, the fragment’s alpha value is also rounded to the nearest inte-
ger. The possible constants specifying the test function areNEVER,ALWAYS,LESS,
LEQUAL, EQUAL, GEQUAL, GREATER, or NOTEQUAL, meaning pass the fragment
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 202
never, always, if the fragment’s alpha value is less than, less than or equal to, equal
to, greater than or equal to, greater than, or not equal to the reference value, respec-
tively.
The required state consists of the ?oating-point reference value, an eight-
valued integer indicating the comparison function, and a bit indicating if the com-
parison is enabled or disabled. The initial state is for the reference value to be 0
and the function to beALWAYS. Initially, the alpha test is disabled.
4.1.5 Stencil Test
The stencil test conditionally discards a fragment based on the outcome of a com-
parison between the value in the stencil buffer at location(x ,y ) and a reference
w w
value. The test is enabled or disabled with the Enable and Disable commands,
using the symbolic constant STENCIL TEST. When disabled, the stencil test and
associated modi?cations are not made, and the fragment is always passed.
The stencil test is controlled with
void StencilFunc(enum func,int ref,uint mask );
void StencilFuncSeparate(enum face,enum func,int ref,
uint mask );
void StencilOp(enum sfail,enum dpfail,enum dppass );
void StencilOpSeparate(enum face,enum sfail,enum dpfail,
enum dppass );
There are two sets of stencil-related state, the front stencil state set and the back
stencil state set. Stencil tests and writes use the front set of stencil state when pro-
cessing fragments rasterized from non-polygon primitives (points, lines, bitmaps,
image rectangles) and front-facing polygon primitives while the back set of stencil
state is used when processing fragments rasterized from back-facing polygon prim-
itives. For the purposes of stencil testing, a primitive is still considered a polygon
even if the polygon is to be rasterized as points or lines due to the current poly-
gon mode. Whether a polygon is front- or back-facing is determined in the same
manner used for two-sided lighting and face culling (see sections 2.14.1 and 3.5.1).
StencilFuncSeparate and StencilOpSeparate take a face argument which can
beFRONT,BACK, orFRONT AND BACK and indicates which set of state is affected.
StencilFunc and StencilOp set front and back stencil state to identical values.
StencilFunc and StencilFuncSeparate take three arguments that control
whether the stencil test passes or fails. ref is an integer reference value that is
s
used in the unsigned stencil comparison. It is clamped to the range [0,2 ? 1],
where s is the number of bits in the stencil buffer. The s least signi?cant bits of
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 203
mask are bitwise ANDed with both the reference and the stored stencil value, and
the resulting masked values are those that participate in the comparison controlled
by func. func is a symbolic constant that determines the stencil comparison func-
tion; the eight symbolic constants are NEVER, ALWAYS, LESS, LEQUAL, EQUAL,
GEQUAL, GREATER, or NOTEQUAL. Accordingly, the stencil test passes never, al-
ways, and if the masked reference value is less than, less than or equal to, equal to,
greater than or equal to, greater than, or not equal to the masked stored value in the
stencil buffer.
StencilOp and StencilOpSeparate take three arguments that indicate what
happens to the stored stencil value if this or certain subsequent tests fail or pass.
sfail indicates what action is taken if the stencil test fails. The symbolic constants
are KEEP, ZERO, REPLACE, INCR, DECR, INVERT, INCR WRAP, and DECR WRAP.
These correspond to keeping the current value, setting to zero, replacing with the
reference value, incrementing with saturation, decrementing with saturation, bit-
wise inverting it, incrementing without saturation, and decrementing without satu-
ration.
For purposes of increment and decrement, the stencil bits are considered as an
unsigned integer. Incrementing or decrementing with saturation clamps the stencil
value at 0 and the maximum representable value. Incrementing or decrementing
without saturation will wrap such that incrementing the maximum representable
value results in0, and decrementing0 results in the maximum representable value.
The same symbolic values are given to indicate the stencil action if the depth
buffer test (see section 4.1.6) fails (dpfail), or if it passes (dppass).
If the stencil test fails, the incoming fragment is discarded. The state required
consists of the most recent values passed to StencilFunc or StencilFuncSeparate
and to StencilOp or StencilOpSeparate, and a bit indicating whether stencil test-
ing is enabled or disabled. In the initial state, stenciling is disabled, the front and
back stencil reference value are both zero, the front and back stencil comparison
functions are both ALWAYS, and the front and back stencil mask are both all ones.
Initially, all three front and back stencil operations areKEEP.
If there is no stencil buffer, no stencil modi?cation can occur, and it is as if the
stencil tests always pass, regardless of any calls to StencilFunc.
4.1.6 Depth Buffer Test
The depth buffer test discards the incoming fragment if a depth comparison fails.
The comparison is enabled or disabled with the generic Enable and Disable com-
mands using the symbolic constant DEPTH TEST. When disabled, the depth com-
parison and subsequent possible updates to the depth buffer value are bypassed and
the fragment is passed to the next operation. The stencil value, however, is modi-
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 204
?ed as indicated below as if the depth buffer test passed. If enabled, the comparison
takes place and the depth buffer and stencil value may subsequently be modi?ed.
The comparison is speci?ed with
void DepthFunc(enum func );
This command takes a single symbolic constant: one of NEVER, ALWAYS, LESS,
LEQUAL, EQUAL, GREATER, GEQUAL, NOTEQUAL. Accordingly, the depth buffer
test passes never, always, if the incoming fragment’s z value is less than, less
w
than or equal to, equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, or not equal to
the depth value stored at the location given by the incoming fragment’s (x ,y )
w w
coordinates.
If the depth buffer test fails, the incoming fragment is discarded. The stencil
value at the fragment’s (x ,y ) coordinates is updated according to the function
w w
currently in effect for depth buffer test failure. Otherwise, the fragment continues
to the next operation and the value of the depth buffer at the fragment’s (x ,y )
w w
location is set to the fragment’sz value. In this case the stencil value is updated
w
according to the function currently in effect for depth buffer test success.
The necessary state is an eight-valued integer and a single bit indicating
whether depth buffering is enabled or disabled. In the initial state the function
isLESS and the test is disabled.
If there is no depth buffer, it is as if the depth buffer test always passes.
4.1.7 Occlusion Queries
Occlusion queries can be used to track the number of fragments or samples that
pass the depth test.
Occlusion queries are associated with query objects.
An occlusion query can be started and ?nished by calling
void BeginQuery(enum target,uint id );
void EndQuery(enum target );
where target isSAMPLES PASSED. If BeginQuery is called with an unused id, that
name is marked as used and associated with a new query object.
BeginQuery with a target of SAMPLES PASSED resets the current samples-
passed count to zero and sets the query active state to TRUE and the active query
id to id. EndQuery with a target of SAMPLES PASSED initializes a copy of the
current samples-passed count into the active occlusion query object’s results value,
sets the active occlusion query object’s result available to FALSE, sets the query
active state toFALSE, and the active query id to 0.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 205
If BeginQuery is called with an id of zero, while another query is already in
progress with the same target, or where id is the name of a query currently in
progress, anINVALID OPERATION error is generated.
If EndQuery is called while no query with the same target is in progress, an
INVALID OPERATION error is generated.
When an occlusion query is active, the samples-passed count increases by
a certain quantity for each fragment that passes the depth test. If the value of
SAMPLE BUFFERS is 0, then the samples-passed count increases by 1 for each
fragment. If the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is 1, then the samples-passed count
increases by the number of samples whose coverage bit is set. However, imple-
mentations, at their discretion, are allowed to instead increase the samples-passed
count by the value ofSAMPLES if any sample in the fragment is covered.
n
If the samples-passed count over?ows, i.e., exceeds the value2 ? 1 (wheren
is the number of bits in the samples-passed count), its value becomes unde?ned. It
is recommended, but not required, that implementations handle this over?ow case
n
by saturating at2 ? 1 and incrementing no further.
The command
void GenQueries(sizei n,uint *ids );
returns n previously unused query object names in ids. These names are marked
as used, but no object is associated with them until the ?rst time they are used by
BeginQuery. Query objects contain one piece of state, an integer result value. This
result value is initialized to zero when the object is created. Any positive integer
except for zero (which is reserved for the GL) is a valid query object name.
Query objects are deleted by calling
void DeleteQueries(sizei n,const uint *ids );
ids contains n names of query objects to be deleted. After a query object is deleted,
its name is again unused. Unused names in ids are silently ignored.
Calling either GenQueries or DeleteQueries while any query of any target is
active causes anINVALID OPERATION error to be generated.
The necessary state is a single bit indicating whether an occlusion query is
active, the identi?er of the currently active occlusion query, and a counter keeping
track of the number of samples that have passed.
4.1.8 Blending
Blending combines the incoming source fragment’s R, G, B, and A values with
the destination R, G, B, and A values stored in the framebuffer at the fragment’s
(x ,y ) location.
w w
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 206
Source and destination values are combined according to the blend equation,
quadruplets of source and destination weighting factors determined by the blend
functions, and a constant blend color to obtain a new set of R, G, B, and A values,
as described below. Each of these ?oating-point values is clamped to [0,1] and
converted back to a ?xed-point value in the manner described in section 2.14.9.
The resulting four values are sent to the next operation.
Blending is dependent on the incoming fragment’s alpha value and that of the
corresponding currently stored pixel. Blending applies only in RGBA mode; in
color index mode it is bypassed. Blending is enabled or disabled using Enable or
Disable with the symbolic constantBLEND. If it is disabled, or if logical operation
on color values is enabled (section 4.1.10), proceed to the next operation.
If multiple fragment colors are being written to multiple buffers (see sec-
tion 4.2.1), blending is computed and applied separately for each fragment color
and the corresponding buffer.
Blend Equation
Blending is controlled by the blend equations, de?ned by the commands
void BlendEquation(enum mode );
void BlendEquationSeparate(enum modeRGB,
enum modeAlpha );
BlendEquationSeparate argument modeRGB determines the RGB blend func-
tion while modeAlpha determines the alpha blend equation. BlendEqua-
tion argument mode determines both the RGB and alpha blend equations.
modeRGB and modeAlpha must each be one of FUNC ADD, FUNC SUBTRACT,
FUNC REVERSE SUBTRACT,MIN,MAX, orLOGIC OP.
Destination (framebuffer) components are taken to be ?xed-point values rep-
resented according to the scheme in section 2.14.9 (Final Color Processing), as
are source (fragment) components. Constant color components are taken to be
?oating-point values.
Prior to blending, each ?xed-point color component undergoes an implied con-
version to ?oating-point. This conversion must leave the values 0 and 1 invariant.
Blending components are treated as if carried out in ?oating-point.
Table 4.1 provides the corresponding per-component blend equations for each
mode, whether acting on RGB components for modeRGB or the alpha component
for modeAlpha.
In the table, the s subscript on a color component abbreviation (R, G, B, or
A) refers to the source color component for an incoming fragment, thed subscript

Blend Color
The constant colorC to be used in blending is speci?ed with the command
c
void BlendColor(clampf red,clampf green,clampf blue,
clampf alpha );
The four parameters are clamped to the range [0,1] before being stored. The
constant color can be used in both the source and destination blending functions
Blending State
The state required for blending is two integers for the RGB and alpha blend equa-
tions, four integers indicating the source and destination RGB and alpha blending
functions, four ?oating-point values to store the RGBA constant blend color, and a
bit indicating whether blending is enabled or disabled. The initial blend equations
for RGB and alpha are bothFUNC ADD. The initial blending functions areONE for
the source RGB and alpha functions and ZERO for the destination RGB and alpha
functions. The initial constant blend color is (R,G,B,A) = (0,0,0,0). Initially,
blending is disabled.
Blending occurs once for each color buffer currently enabled for writing (sec-
tion 4.2.1) using each buffer’s color forC . If a color buffer has no A value, then
d
A is taken to be1.

4.1.9 Dithering
Dithering selects between two color values or indices. In RGBA mode, consider
the value of any of the color components as a ?xed-point value withm bits to the
left of the binary point, wherem is the number of bits allocated to that component
in the framebuffer; call each such value c. For each c, dithering selects a value
c such that c ?{max{0,dce? 1},dce} (after this selection, treat c as a ?xed
1 1 1
point value in [0,1] with m bits). This selection may depend on the x and y
w w
coordinates of the pixel. In color index mode, the same rule applies withc being a
single color index. c must not be larger than the maximum value representable in
the framebuffer for either the component or the index, as appropriate.
Many dithering algorithms are possible, but a dithered value produced by any
algorithm must depend only the incoming value and the fragment’sx andy window
coordinates. If dithering is disabled, then each color component is truncated to a
?xed-point value with as many bits as there are in the corresponding component in
the framebuffer; a color index is rounded to the nearest integer representable in the
color index portion of the framebuffer.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.1. PER-FRAGMENTOPERATIONS 210
Dithering is enabled with Enable and disabled with Disable using the symbolic
constant DITHER. The state required is thus a single bit. Initially, dithering is
enabled.
4.1.10 Logical Operation
Finally, a logical operation is applied between the incoming fragment’s color or
index values and the color or index values stored at the corresponding location in
the framebuffer. The result replaces the values in the framebuffer at the fragment’s
(x ,y ) coordinates. The logical operation on color indices is enabled or dis-
w w
abled with Enable or Disable using the symbolic constantINDEX LOGIC OP. (For
compatibility with GL version 1.0, the symbolic constant LOGIC OP may also be
used.) The logical operation on color values is enabled or disabled with Enable or
Disable using the symbolic constant COLOR LOGIC OP. If the logical operation is
enabled for color values, it is as if blending were disabled, regardless of the value
of BLEND. If multiple fragment colors are being written to multiple buffers (see
section 4.2.1), the logical operation is computed and applied separately for each
fragment color and the corresponding buffer.
The logical operation is selected by
void LogicOp(enum op );
op is a symbolic constant; the possible constants and corresponding operations are
enumerated in table 4.3. In this table,s is the value of the incoming fragment andd
is the value stored in the framebuffer. The numeric values assigned to the symbolic
constants are the same as those assigned to the corresponding symbolic values in
the X window system.
Logical operations are performed independently for each color index buffer
that is selected for writing, or for each red, green, blue, and alpha value of each
color buffer that is selected for writing. The required state is an integer indicating
the logical operation, and two bits indicating whether the logical operation is en-
abled or disabled. The initial state is for the logic operation to be given by COPY,
and to be disabled.
4.1.11 Additional Multisample Fragment Operations
If the DrawBuffer mode isNONE, no change is made to any multisample or color
buffer. Otherwise, fragment processing is as described below.
If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is one, the
alpha test, stencil test, depth test, blending, and dithering operations are performed
for each pixel sample, rather than just once for each fragment. Failure of the alpha,

stencil, or depth test results in termination of the processing of that sample, rather
than discarding of the fragment. All operations are performed on the color, depth,
and stencil values stored in the multisample buffer (to be described in a following
section). The contents of the color buffers are not modi?ed at this point.
Stencil, depth, blending, and dithering operations are performed for a pixel
sample only if that sample’s fragment coverage bit is a value of 1. If the corre-
sponding coverage bit is 0, no operations are performed for that sample.
If MULTISAMPLE is disabled, and the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is one, the
fragment may be treated exactly as described above, with optimization possible
because the fragment coverage must be set to full coverage. Further optimization is
allowed, however. An implementation may choose to identify a centermost sample,
and to perform alpha, stencil, and depth tests on only that sample. Regardless of
the outcome of the stencil test, all multisample buffer stencil sample values are set
to the appropriate new stencil value. If the depth test passes, all multisample buffer
depth sample values are set to the depth of the fragment’s centermost sample’s
depth value, and all multisample buffer color sample values are set to the color
value of the incoming fragment. Otherwise, no change is made to any multisample
buffer color or depth value.
After all operations have been completed on the multisample buffer, the sample
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.2. WHOLEFRAMEBUFFEROPERATIONS 212
values for each color in the multisample buffer are combined to produce a single
color value, and that value is written into the corresponding color buffers selected
by DrawBuffer or DrawBuffers. An implementation may defer the writing of the
color buffers until a later time, but the state of the framebuffer must behave as if
the color buffers were updated as each fragment was processed. The method of
combination is not speci?ed, though a simple average computed independently for
each color component is recommended.
4.2 Whole Framebuffer Operations
The preceding sections described the operations that occur as individual fragments
are sent to the framebuffer. This section describes operations that control or affect
the whole framebuffer.
4.2.1 Selecting a Buffer for Writing
The ?rst such operation is controlling the color buffers into which each of the frag-
ment colors are written. This is accomplished with either DrawBuffer or Draw-
Buffers.
The command
void DrawBuffer(enum buf );
de?nes the set of color buffers to which fragment color zero is written. buf is a
symbolic constant specifying zero, one, two, or four buffers for writing. The con-
stants areNONE,FRONT LEFT,FRONT RIGHT,BACK LEFT,BACK RIGHT,FRONT,
BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, FRONT AND BACK, and AUX0 through AUXm, where m+1
is the number of available auxiliary buffers.
The constants refer to the four potentially visible buffers front left, front right,
back left, and back right, and to the auxiliary buffers. Arguments other thanAUXi
that omit reference to LEFT or RIGHT refer to both left and right buffers. Argu-
ments other thanAUXi that omit reference toFRONT orBACK refer to both front and
back buffers. AUXi enables drawing only to auxiliary bufferi. Each AUXi adheres
to AUXi = AUX0+i. The constants and the buffers they indicate are summarized
in table 4.4. If DrawBuffer is is supplied with a constant (other than NONE) that
does not indicate any of the color buffers allocated to the GL context, the error
INVALID OPERATION results.
DrawBuffer will set the draw buffer for fragment colors other than zero to
NONE.

Table 4.4: Arguments to DrawBuffer and the buffers that they indicate.
void DrawBuffers(sizei n,const enum *bufs );
de?nes the draw buffers to which all fragment colors are written. n speci?es the
number of buffers in bufs. bufs is a pointer to an array of symbolic constants
specifying the buffer to which each fragment color is written. The constants may be
NONE,FRONT LEFT, FRONT RIGHT,BACK LEFT,BACK RIGHT, andAUX0 through
AUXm, wherem+1 is the number of available auxiliary buffers. The draw buffers
being de?ned correspond in order to the respective fragment colors. The draw
buffer for fragment colors beyond n is set toNONE.
Except for NONE, a buffer may not appear more then once in the array
pointed to by bufs. Specifying a buffer more then once will result in the error
INVALID OPERATION.
If ?xed-function fragment shading is being performed, DrawBuffers speci?es
a set of draw buffers into which the fragment color is written.
If a fragment shader writes to gl FragColor, DrawBuffers speci?es a set
of draw buffers into which the single fragment color de?ned by gl FragColor
is written. If a fragment shader writes to gl FragData, DrawBuffers speci?es
a set of draw buffers into which each of the multiple fragment colors de?ned
by gl FragData are separately written. If a fragment shader writes to neither
gl FragColor nor gl FragData, the values of the fragment colors following
shader execution are unde?ned, and may differ for each fragment color.
The maximum number of draw buffers is implementation dependent and must
be at least 1. The number of draw buffers supported can be queried by calling
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.2. WHOLEFRAMEBUFFEROPERATIONS 214
GetIntegerv with the symbolic constantMAX DRAW BUFFERS.
The constants FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, and FRONT AND BACK are not
valid in the bufs array passed to DrawBuffers, and will result in the error
INVALID OPERATION. This restriction is because these constants may themselves
refer to multiple buffers, as shown in table 4.4.
If DrawBuffers is supplied with a constant (other than NONE) that does
not indicate any of the color buffers allocated to the GL context, the error
INVALID OPERATION will be generated. If n is greater than the value of
MAX DRAW BUFFERS, the errorINVALID VALUE will be generated.
Indicating a buffer or buffers using DrawBuffer or DrawBuffers causes sub-
sequent pixel color value writes to affect the indicated buffers.
SpecifyingNONE as the draw buffer for an fragment color will inhibit that frag-
ment color from being written to any buffer.
Monoscopic contexts include only left buffers, while stereoscopic contexts in-
clude both left and right buffers. Likewise, single buffered contexts include only
front buffers, while double buffered contexts include both front and back buffers.
The type of context is selected at GL initialization.
The state required to handle color buffer selection is an integer for each sup-
ported fragment color. In the initial state, the draw buffer for fragment color zero
isFRONT if there are no back buffers; otherwise it isBACK. The initial state of draw
buffers for fragment colors other then zero isNONE.
4.2.2 Fine Control of Buffer Updates
Four commands are used to mask the writing of bits to each of the logical frame-
buffers after all per-fragment operations have been performed. The commands
void IndexMask(uint mask );
void ColorMask(boolean r,boolean g,boolean b,
boolean a );
control the color buffer or buffers (depending on which buffers are currently indi-
cated for writing). The least signi?cant n bits of mask, where n is the number of
bits in a color index buffer, specify a mask. Where a 1 appears in this mask, the
corresponding bit in the color index buffer (or buffers) is written; where a 0 ap-
pears, the bit is not written. This mask applies only in color index mode. In RGBA
mode, ColorMask is used to mask the writing of R, G, B and A values to the color
buffer or buffers. r, g, b, and a indicate whether R, G, B, or A values, respectively,
are written or not (a value ofTRUE means that the corresponding value is written).
In the initial state, all bits (in color index mode) and all color values (in RGBA
mode) are enabled for writing.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.2. WHOLEFRAMEBUFFEROPERATIONS 215
The depth buffer can be enabled or disabled for writingz values using
w
void DepthMask(boolean mask );
If mask is non-zero, the depth buffer is enabled for writing; otherwise, it is disabled.
In the initial state, the depth buffer is enabled for writing.
The commands
void StencilMask(uint mask );
void StencilMaskSeparate(enum face,uint mask );
control the writing of particular bits into the stencil planes.
The least signi?cants bits of mask comprise an integer mask (s is the number
of bits in the stencil buffer), just as for IndexMask. The face parameter of Stencil-
MaskSeparate can be FRONT, BACK, or FRONT AND BACK and indicates whether
the front or back stencil mask state is affected. StencilMask sets both front and
back stencil mask state to identical values.
Fragments generated by front facing primitives use the front mask and frag-
ments generated by back facing primitives use the back mask (see section 4.1.5).
The clear operation always uses the front stencil write mask when clearing the
stencil buffer.
The state required for the various masking operations is three integers and a
bit: an integer for color indices, an integer for the front and back stencil values,
and a bit for depth values. A set of four bits is also required indicating which color
components of an RGBA value should be written. In the initial state, the integer
masks are all ones, as are the bits controlling depth value and RGBA component
writing.
Fine Control of Multisample Buffer Updates
When the value ofSAMPLE BUFFERS is one, ColorMask, DepthMask, and Sten-
cilMask or StencilMaskSeparate control the modi?cation of values in the mul-
tisample buffer. The color mask has no effect on modi?cations to the color buffers.
If the color mask is entirely disabled, the color sample values must still be com-
bined (as described above) and the result used to replace the color values of the
buffers enabled by DrawBuffer.
4.2.3 Clearing the Buffers
The GL provides a means for setting portions of every pixel in a particular buffer
to the same value. The argument to
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.2. WHOLEFRAMEBUFFEROPERATIONS 216
void Clear(bitfield buf );
is the bitwise OR of a number of values indicating which buffers are
to be cleared. The values are COLOR BUFFER BIT, DEPTH BUFFER BIT,
STENCIL BUFFER BIT, andACCUM BUFFER BIT, indicating the buffers currently
enabled for color writing, the depth buffer, the stencil buffer, and the accumulation
buffer (see below), respectively. The value to which each buffer is cleared depends
on the setting of the clear value for that buffer. If the mask is not a bitwise OR of
the speci?ed values, then the errorINVALID VALUE is generated.
void ClearColor(clampf r,clampf g,clampf b,
clampf a );
sets the clear value for the color buffers in RGBA mode. Each of the speci?ed
components is clamped to[0,1] and converted to ?xed-point according to the rules
of section 2.14.9.
void ClearIndex(float index );
sets the clear color index. index is converted to a ?xed-point value with unspeci?ed
precision to the left of the binary point; the integer part of this value is then masked
m
with 2 ? 1, where m is the number of bits in a color index value stored in the
framebuffer.
void ClearDepth(clampd d );
takes a ?oating-point value that is clamped to the range [0,1] and converted to
?xed-point according to the rules for a window z value given in section 2.11.1.
Similarly,
void ClearStencil(int s );
takes a single integer argument that is the value to which to clear the stencil buffer.
s is masked to the number of bitplanes in the stencil buffer.
void ClearAccum(float r,float g,float b,float a );
takes four ?oating-point arguments that are the values, in order, to which to set the
R, G, B, and A values of the accumulation buffer (see the next section). These
values are clamped to the range[? 1,1] when they are speci?ed.
When Clear is called, the only per-fragment operations that are applied (if
enabled) are the pixel ownership test, the scissor test, and dithering. The masking
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.2. WHOLEFRAMEBUFFEROPERATIONS 217
operations described in the last section (4.2.2) are also effective. If a buffer is not
present, then a Clear directed at that buffer has no effect.
The state required for clearing is a clear value for each of the color buffer, the
depth buffer, the stencil buffer, and the accumulation buffer. Initially, the RGBA
color clear value is (0,0,0,0), the clear color index is 0, and the stencil buffer and
accumulation buffer clear values are all 0. The depth buffer clear value is initially
1.0.
Clearing the Multisample Buffer
The color samples of the multisample buffer are cleared when one or more color
buffers are cleared, as speci?ed by the Clear mask bit COLOR BUFFER BIT and
the DrawBuffer mode. If the DrawBuffer mode isNONE, the color samples of the
multisample buffer cannot be cleared.
If the Clear mask bitsDEPTH BUFFER BIT orSTENCIL BUFFER BIT are set,
then the corresponding depth or stencil samples, respectively, are cleared.
4.2.4 The Accumulation Buffer
Each portion of a pixel in the accumulation buffer consists of four values: one for
each of R, G, B, and A. The accumulation buffer is controlled exclusively through
the use of
void Accum(enum op,float value );
(except for clearing it). op is a symbolic constant indicating an accumulation buffer
operation, and value is a ?oating-point value to be used in that operation. The
possible operations areACCUM,LOAD,RETURN,MULT, andADD.
When the scissor test is enabled (section 4.1.2), then only those pixels within
the current scissor box are updated by any Accum operation; otherwise, all pixels
in the window are updated. The accumulation buffer operations apply identically
to every affected pixel, so we describe the effect of each operation on an individ-
ual pixel. Accumulation buffer values are taken to be signed values in the range
[? 1,1]. UsingACCUM obtains R, G, B, and A components from the buffer currently
selected for reading (section 4.3.2). Each component, considered as a ?xed-point
value in [0,1]. (see section 2.14.9), is converted to ?oating-point. Each result is
then multiplied by value. The results of this multiplication are then added to the
corresponding color component currently in the accumulation buffer, and the re-
sulting color value replaces the current accumulation buffer color value.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.3. DRAWING,READING,ANDCOPYINGPIXELS 218
The LOAD operation has the same effect as ACCUM, but the computed values
replace the corresponding accumulation buffer components rather than being added
to them.
The RETURN operation takes each color value from the accumulation buffer,
multiplies each of the R, G, B, and A components by value, and clamps the re-
sults to the range [0,1] The resulting color value is placed in the buffers currently
enabled for color writing as if it were a fragment produced from rasterization, ex-
cept that the only per-fragment operations that are applied (if enabled) are the pixel
ownership test, the scissor test (section 4.1.2), and dithering (section 4.1.9). Color
masking (section 4.2.2) is also applied.
TheMULT operation multiplies each R, G, B, and A in the accumulation buffer
by value and then returns the scaled color components to their corresponding ac-
cumulation buffer locations. ADD is the same as MULT except that value is added
to each of the color components.
The color components operated on by Accum must be clamped only if the
operation is RETURN. In this case, a value sent to the enabled color buffers is ?rst
clamped to [0,1]. Otherwise, results are unde?ned if the result of an operation on
a color component is out of the range[? 1,1].
If there is no accumulation buffer, or if the GL is in color index mode, Accum
generates the errorINVALID OPERATION.
No state (beyond the accumulation buffer itself) is required for accumulation
buffering.
4.3 Drawing, Reading, and Copying Pixels
Pixels may be written to and read from the framebuffer using the DrawPixels and
ReadPixels commands. CopyPixels can be used to copy a block of pixels from
one portion of the framebuffer to another.
4.3.1 Writing to the Stencil Buffer
The operation of DrawPixels was described in section 3.6.4, except if the format
argument was STENCIL INDEX. In this case, all operations described for Draw-
Pixels take place, but window (x,y) coordinates, each with the corresponding
stencil index, are produced in lieu of fragments. Each coordinate-stencil index
pair is sent directly to the per-fragment operations, bypassing the texture, fog, and
antialiasing application stages of rasterization. Each pair is then treated as a frag-
ment for purposes of the pixel ownership and scissor tests; all other per-fragment
operations are bypassed. Finally, each stencil index is written to its indicated
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.3. DRAWING,READING,ANDCOPYINGPIXELS 219
location in the framebuffer, subject to the current front stencil mask (set with Sten-
cilMask or StencilMaskSeparate). If a depth component is present, and the set-
ting of DepthMask is notFALSE, is also written to the framebuffer; the setting of
DepthTest is ignored.
The errorINVALID OPERATION results if there is no stencil buffer.
4.3.2 Reading Pixels
The method for reading pixels from the framebuffer and placing them in client
memory is diagrammed in ?gure 4.2. We describe the stages of the pixel reading
process in the order in which they occur.
Pixels are read using
void ReadPixels(int x,int y,sizei width,sizei height,
enum format,enum type,void *data );
The arguments after x and y to ReadPixels correspond to those of DrawPixels.
The pixel storage modes that apply to ReadPixels and other commands that query
images (see section 6.1) are summarized in table 4.5.
Obtaining Pixels from the Framebuffer
If the format isDEPTH COMPONENT, then values are obtained from the depth buffer.
If there is no depth buffer, the errorINVALID OPERATION occurs.
If there is a multisample buffer (the value of SAMPLE BUFFERS is one), then
values are obtained from the depth samples in this buffer. It is recommended that
the depth value of the centermost sample be used, though implementations may
choose any function of the depth sample values at each pixel.
If the format isSTENCIL INDEX, then values are taken from the stencil buffer;
again, if there is no stencil buffer, the errorINVALID OPERATION occurs.
If there is a multisample buffer, then values are obtained from the stencil sam-
ples in this buffer. It is recommended that the stencil value of the centermost sam-
ple be used, though implementations may choose any function of the stencil sample
values at each pixel.
For all other formats, the buffer from which values are obtained is one of the
color buffers; the selection of color buffer is controlled with ReadBuffer.
The command
void ReadBuffer(enum src );

takes a symbolic constant as argument. The possible values are FRONT LEFT,
FRONT RIGHT,BACK LEFT,BACK RIGHT,FRONT,BACK,LEFT,RIGHT, andAUX0
through AUXn. FRONT and LEFT refer to the front left buffer, BACK refers to the
back left buffer, andRIGHT refers to the front right buffer. The other constants cor-
respond directly to the buffers that they name. If the requested buffer is missing,
then the error INVALID OPERATION is generated. The initial setting for Read-
Buffer isFRONT if there is no back buffer andBACK otherwise.
ReadPixels obtains values from the selected buffer from each pixel with lower
left hand corner at(x+i,y+j) for0? i<width and0? j <height; this pixel
is said to be the ith pixel in the jth row. If any of these pixels lies outside of the
window allocated to the current GL context, the values obtained for those pixels
are unde?ned. Results are also unde?ned for individual pixels that are not owned
by the current context. Otherwise, ReadPixels obtains values from the selected
buffer, regardless of how those values were placed there.
If the GL is in RGBA mode, and format is one ofRED,GREEN,BLUE,ALPHA,
RGB,RGBA,BGR,BGRA,LUMINANCE, orLUMINANCE ALPHA, then red, green, blue,
and alpha values are obtained from the selected buffer at each pixel location.
If the framebuffer does not support alpha values then the A that is obtained is
1.0. If format is COLOR INDEX and the GL is in RGBA mode then the error
INVALID OPERATION occurs. If the GL is in color index mode, and format is
not DEPTH COMPONENT or STENCIL INDEX, then the color index is obtained at
each pixel location.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20044.3. DRAWING,READING,ANDCOPYINGPIXELS 222
Conversion of RGBA values
This step applies only if the GL is in RGBA mode, and then only if format is
neitherSTENCIL INDEX norDEPTH COMPONENT. The R, G, B, and A values form
a group of elements. Each element is taken to be a ?xed-point value in [0,1] with
m bits, wherem is the number of bits in the corresponding color component of the
selected buffer (see section 2.14.9).
Conversion of Depth values
This step applies only if format isDEPTH COMPONENT. An element is taken to be a
?xed-point value in [0,1] withm bits, wherem is the number of bits in the depth
buffer (see section 2.11.1).
Pixel Transfer Operations
This step is actually the sequence of steps that was described separately in sec-
tion 3.6.5. After the processing described in that section is completed, groups are
processed as described in the following sections.
Conversion to L
This step applies only to RGBA component groups, and only if the format is either
LUMINANCE orLUMINANCE ALPHA. A value L is computed as
L =R+G+B
where R, G, and B are the values of the R, G, and B components. The single
computed L component replaces the R, G, and B components in the group.
Final Conversion
For an index, if the type is not FLOAT, ?nal conversion consists of masking the
index with the value given in table 4.6; if the type isFLOAT, then the integer index
is converted to a GL ?oat data value.
For an RGBA color, each component is ?rst clamped to [0,1]. Then the
appropriate conversion formula from table 4.7 is applied to the component.
Placement in Client Memory
Groups of elements are placed in memory just as they are taken from memory for
DrawPixels. That is, theith group of thejth row (corresponding to theith pixel in

thejth row) is placed in memory just where theith group of thejth row would be
taken from for DrawPixels. See Unpacking under section 3.6.4. The only differ-
ence is that the storage mode parameters whose names begin withPACK are used
instead of those whose names begin with UNPACK . If the format is RED, GREEN,
BLUE, ALPHA, or LUMINANCE, only the corresponding single element is written.
Likewise if the format isLUMINANCE ALPHA,RGB, orBGR, only the corresponding
two or three elements are written. Otherwise all the elements of each group are
written.
4.3.3 Copying Pixels
CopyPixels transfers a rectangle of pixel values from one region of the framebuffer
to another. Pixel copying is diagrammed in ?gure 4.3.
void CopyPixels(int x,int y,sizei width,sizei height,
enum type );
type is a symbolic constant that must be one ofCOLOR,STENCIL, orDEPTH, indi-
cating that the values to be transferred are colors, stencil values, or depth values,
respectively. The ?rst four arguments have the same interpretation as the corre-
sponding arguments to ReadPixels.
Values are obtained from the framebuffer, converted (if appropriate), then sub-
jected to the pixel transfer operations described in section 3.6.5, just as if Read-
Pixels were called with the corresponding arguments. If the type is STENCIL
or DEPTH, then it is as if the format for ReadPixels were STENCIL INDEX or
DEPTH COMPONENT, respectively. If the type isCOLOR, then if the GL is in RGBA
mode, it is as if the format wereRGBA, while if the GL is in color index mode, it is
as if the format wereCOLOR INDEX.

Table 4.7: Reversed component conversions, used when component data are being
returned to client memory. Color, normal, and depth components are converted
from the internal ?oating-point representation (f) to a datum of the speci?ed GL
data type (c) using the speci?ed equation. All arithmetic is done in the internal
?oating point format. These conversions apply to component data returned by GL
query commands and to components of pixel data returned to client memory. The
equations remain the same even if the implemented ranges of the GL data types are
greater than the minimum required ranges. (See table 2.2.) Equations with N as
the exponent are performed for each bit?eld of the packed data type, withN set to
the number of bits in the bit?eld.

4.3.4 Pixel Draw/Read State
The state required for pixel operations consists of the parameters that are set with
PixelStore, PixelTransfer, and PixelMap. This state has been summarized in
tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. The current setting of ReadBuffer, an integer, is also
required, along with the current raster position (section 2.13). State set with Pixel-
Store is GL client state.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Chapter 5
Special Functions
This chapter describes additional GL functionality that does not ?t easily into any
of the preceding chapters. This functionality consists of evaluators (used to model
curves and surfaces), selection (used to locate rendered primitives on the screen),
feedback (which returns GL results before rasterization), display lists (used to des-
ignate a group of GL commands for later execution by the GL), ?ushing and ?n-
ishing (used to synchronize the GL command stream), and hints.
5.1 Evaluators
Evaluators provide a means to use a polynomial or rational polynomial mapping
to produce vertex, normal, and texture coordinates, and colors. The values so pro-
duced are sent on to further stages of the GL as if they had been provided directly
by the client. Transformations, lighting, primitive assembly, rasterization, and per-
pixel operations are not affected by the use of evaluators.

calling Map{12} generates the errorINVALID OPERATION.
Figure 5.1 describes map evaluation schematically; an evaluation of enabled
maps is effected in one of two ways. The ?rst way is to use
void EvalCoord{12}{fd}(T arg );
void EvalCoord{12}{fd}v(T arg );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.1. EVALUATORS 230
EvalCoord1 causes evaluation of the enabled one-dimensional maps. The argu-
0
ment is the value (or a pointer to the value) that is the domain coordinate,u . Eval-
Coord2 causes evaluation of the enabled two-dimensional maps. The two values
0 0
specify the two domain coordinates,u andv , in that order.
When one of the EvalCoord commands is issued, all currently enabled maps
of the indicated dimension are evaluated. Then, for each enabled map, it is as if a
corresponding GL command were issued with the resulting coordinates, with one
important difference. The difference is that when an evaluation is performed, the
GL uses evaluated values instead of current values for those evaluations that are
enabled (otherwise, the current values are used). The order of the effective com-
mands is immaterial, except that Vertex (for vertex coordinate evaluation) must be
issued last. Use of evaluators has no effect on the current color, normal, or texture
coordinates. If ColorMaterial is enabled, evaluated color values affect the result
of the lighting equation as if the current color was being modi?ed, but no change
is made to the tracking lighting parameters or to the current color.
No command is effectively issued if the corresponding map (of the indicated
dimension) is not enabled. If more than one evaluation is enabled for a particu-
lar dimension (e.g. MAP1 TEXTURE COORD 1 andMAP1 TEXTURE COORD 2), then
only the result of the evaluation of the map with the highest number of coordinates
is used.
Finally, if eitherMAP2 VERTEX 3 orMAP2 VERTEX 4 is enabled, then the nor-
mal to the surface is computed. Analytic computation, which sometimes yields
normals of length zero, is one method which may be used. If automatic normal
generation is enabled, then this computed normal is used as the normal associated
with a generated vertex. Automatic normal generation is controlled with Enable
and Disable with the symbolic constantAUTO NORMAL. If automatic normal gener-
ation is disabled, then a corresponding normal map, if enabled, is used to produce
a normal. If neither automatic normal generation nor a normal map are enabled,
then no normal is sent with a vertex resulting from an evaluation (the effect is that
the current normal is used).
ForMAP VERTEX 3, letq =p. ForMAP VERTEX 4, letq = (x/w,y/w,z/w),
where(x,y,z,w) =p. Then let
?q ?q
m = ? .
?u ?v
Then the generated analytic normal,n, is given byn = m if a vertex shader is
m
active, or else byn = .
kmk
The second way to carry out evaluations is to use a set of commands that pro-
vide for ef?cient speci?cation of a series of evenly spaced values to be mapped.
This method proceeds in two steps. The ?rst step is to de?ne a grid in the domain.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.1. EVALUATORS 231
This is done using

Once a grid is de?ned, an evaluation on a rectangular subset of that grid may
be carried out by calling

where EvalCoord1f or EvalCoord1d is substituted for EvalCoord1 as appro-
priate. If mode is POINT, then type is POINTS; if mode is LINE, then type is
LINE STRIP. The one requirement is that if eitheri = 0 ori = n, then the value

The corresponding commands for two-dimensional maps are
void EvalMesh2(enum mode,intp ,intp ,intq ,

mode must beFILL,LINE, orPOINT. When mode isFILL, then these commands
0 0 0 0 0 0
are equivalent to the following, with? u = (u ? u )/n and? v = (v ? v )/m:

The state required for evaluators potentially consists of 9 one-dimensional map
speci?cations and 9 two-dimensional map speci?cations, as well as corresponding
?ags for each speci?cation indicating which are enabled. Each map speci?cation
consists of one or two orders, an appropriately sized array of control points, and a
set of two values (for a one-dimensional map) or four values (for a two-dimensional
map) to describe the domain. The maximum possible order, for either u or v, is
implementation dependent (one maximum applies to bothu andv), but must be at
least 8. Each control point consists of between one and four ?oating-point values
(depending on the type of the map). Initially, all maps have order 1 (making them
constant maps). All vertex coordinate maps produce the coordinates (0,0,0,1)
(or the appropriate subset); all normal coordinate maps produce (0,0,1); RGBA
maps produce (1,1,1,1); color index maps produce 1.0; and texture coordinate
maps produce (0,0,0,1). In the initial state, all maps are disabled. A ?ag indi-
cates whether or not automatic normal generation is enabled for two-dimensional
maps. In the initial state, automatic normal generation is disabled. Also required
are two ?oating-point values and an integer number of grid divisions for the one-
dimensional grid speci?cation and four ?oating-point values and two integer grid
divisions for the two-dimensional grid speci?cation. In the initial state, the bounds
of the domain interval for 1-D is 0 and 1.0, respectively; for 2-D, they are (0,0)
and (1.0,1.0), respectively. The number of grid divisions is 1 for 1-D and 1 in
both directions for 2-D. If any evaluation command is issued when no vertex map
is enabled for the map dimension being evaluated, nothing happens.
5.2 Selection
Selection is used to determine which primitives are drawn into some region of a
window. The region is de?ned by the current model-view and perspective matrices.
Selection works by returning an array of integer-valued names. This array
represents the current contents of the name stack. This stack is controlled with the
commands
void InitNames(void );
void PopName(void );
void PushName(uint name );
void LoadName(uint name );
InitNames empties (clears) the name stack. PopName pops one name off the top
of the name stack. PushName causes name to be pushed onto the name stack.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.2. SELECTION 234
LoadName replaces the value on the top of the stack with name. Loading a name
onto an empty stack generates the errorINVALID OPERATION. Popping a name off
of an empty stack generatesSTACK UNDERFLOW; pushing a name onto a full stack
generates STACK OVERFLOW. The maximum allowable depth of the name stack is
implementation dependent but must be at least 64.
In selection mode, framebuffer updates as described in chapter 4 are not per-
formed. The GL is placed in selection mode with
int RenderMode(enum mode );
mode is a symbolic constant: one of RENDER, SELECT, or FEEDBACK. RENDER is
the default, corresponding to rendering as described until now. SELECT speci?es
selection mode, and FEEDBACK speci?es feedback mode (described below). Use
of any of the name stack manipulation commands while the GL is not in selection
mode has no effect.
Selection is controlled using
void SelectBuffer(sizei n,uint *buffer );
buffer is a pointer to an array of unsigned integers (called the selection array) to be
potentially ?lled with names, and n is an integer indicating the maximum number
of values that can be stored in that array. Placing the GL in selection mode before
SelectBuffer has been called results in an error of INVALID OPERATION as does
calling SelectBuffer while in selection mode.
In selection mode, if a point, line, polygon, or the valid coordinates produced
by a RasterPos command intersects the clip volume (section 2.12) then this prim-
itive (or RasterPos command) causes a selection hit. WindowPos commands al-
ways generate a selection hit, since the resulting raster position is always valid.
In the case of polygons, no hit occurs if the polygon would have been culled, but
selection is based on the polygon itself, regardless of the setting of PolygonMode.
When in selection mode, whenever a name stack manipulation command is exe-
cuted or RenderMode is called and there has been a hit since the last time the stack
was manipulated or RenderMode was called, then a hit record is written into the
selection array.
A hit record consists of the following items in order: a non-negative integer
giving the number of elements on the name stack at the time of the hit, a minimum
depth value, a maximum depth value, and the name stack with the bottommost el-
ement ?rst. The minimum and maximum depth values are the minimum and max-
imum taken over all the window coordinatez values of each (post-clipping) vertex
of each primitive that intersects the clipping volume since the last hit record was
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.3. FEEDBACK 235
written. The minimum and maximum (each of which lies in the range [0,1]) are
32
each multiplied by2 ? 1 and rounded to the nearest unsigned integer to obtain the
values that are placed in the hit record. No depth offset arithmetic (section 3.5.5)
is performed on these values.
Hit records are placed in the selection array by maintaining a pointer into that
array. When selection mode is entered, the pointer is initialized to the beginning
of the array. Each time a hit record is copied, the pointer is updated to point at
the array element after the one into which the topmost element of the name stack
was stored. If copying the hit record into the selection array would cause the total
number of values to exceed n, then as much of the record as ?ts in the array is
written and an over?ow ?ag is set.
Selection mode is exited by calling RenderMode with an argument value other
than SELECT. When called while in selection mode, RenderMode returns the
number of hit records copied into the selection array and resets the SelectBuffer
pointer to its last speci?ed value. Values are not guaranteed to be written into the
selection array until RenderMode is called. If the selection array over?ow ?ag
was set, then RenderMode returns? 1 and clears the over?ow ?ag. The name
stack is cleared and the stack pointer reset whenever RenderMode is called.
The state required for selection consists of the address of the selection array
and its maximum size, the name stack and its associated pointer, a minimum and
maximum depth value, and several ?ags. One ?ag indicates the current Render-
Mode value. In the initial state, the GL is in the RENDER mode. Another ?ag is
used to indicate whether or not a hit has occurred since the last name stack ma-
nipulation. This ?ag is reset upon entering selection mode and whenever a name
stack manipulation takes place. One ?nal ?ag is required to indicate whether the
maximum number of copied names would have been exceeded. This ?ag is reset
upon entering selection mode. This ?ag, the address of the selection array, and its
maximum size are GL client state.
5.3 Feedback
The GL is placed in feedback mode by calling RenderMode with FEEDBACK.
When in feedback mode, framebuffer updates as described in chapter 4 are not
performed. Instead, information about primitives that would have otherwise been
rasterized is returned to the application via the feedback buffer.
Feedback is controlled using
void FeedbackBuffer(sizei n,enum type,float *buffer );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.3. FEEDBACK 236
buffer is a pointer to an array of ?oating-point values into which feedback informa-
tion will be placed, and n is a number indicating the maximum number of values
that can be written to that array. type is a symbolic constant describing the informa-
tion to be fed back for each vertex (see ?gure 5.2). The errorINVALID OPERATION
results if the GL is placed in feedback mode before a call to FeedbackBuffer has
been made, or if a call to FeedbackBuffer is made while in feedback mode.
While in feedback mode, each primitive that would be rasterized (or bitmap
or call to DrawPixels or CopyPixels, if the raster position is valid) generates a
block of values that get copied into the feedback array. If doing so would cause
the number of entries to exceed the maximum, the block is partially written so as
to ?ll the array (if there is any room left at all). The ?rst block of values gener-
ated after the GL enters feedback mode is placed at the beginning of the feedback
array, with subsequent blocks following. Each block begins with a code indicat-
ing the primitive type, followed by values that describe the primitive’s vertices and
associated data. Entries are also written for bitmaps and pixel rectangles. Feed-
back occurs after polygon culling (section 3.5.1) and PolygonMode interpretation
of polygons (section 3.5.4) has taken place. It may also occur after polygons with
more than three edges are broken up into triangles (if the GL implementation ren-
ders polygons by performing this decomposition). x,y, andz coordinates returned
by feedback are window coordinates; ifw is returned, it is in clip coordinates. No
depth offset arithmetic (section 3.5.5) is performed on the z values. In the case
of bitmaps and pixel rectangles, the coordinates returned are those of the current
raster position.
The texture coordinates and colors returned are those resulting from the clip-
ping operations described in section 2.14.8. Only coordinates for texture unit
TEXTURE0 are returned even for implementations which support multiple texture
units. The colors returned are the primary colors.
The ordering rules for GL command interpretation also apply in feedback
mode. Each command must be fully interpreted and its effects on both GL state
and the values to be written to the feedback buffer completed before a subsequent
command may be executed.
Feedback mode is exited by calling RenderMode with an argument value
other thanFEEDBACK. When called while in feedback mode, RenderMode returns
the number of values placed in the feedback array and resets the feedback array
pointer to be buffer. The return value never exceeds the maximum number of
values passed to FeedbackBuffer.
If writing a value to the feedback buffer would cause more values to be written
than the speci?ed maximum number of values, then the value is not written and an
over?ow ?ag is set. In this case, RenderMode returns? 1 when it is called, after
which the over?ow ?ag is reset. While in feedback mode, values are not guaranteed

to be written into the feedback buffer before RenderMode is called.
Figure 5.2 gives a grammar for the array produced by feedback. Each primitive
is indicated with a unique identifying value followed by some number of vertices.
A vertex is fed back as some number of ?oating-point values determined by the
feedback type. Table 5.2 gives the correspondence between feedback buffer and
the number of values returned for each vertex.
The command
void PassThrough(float token );
may be used as a marker in feedback mode. token is returned as if it were a prim-
itive; it is indicated with its own unique identifying value. The ordering of any
PassThrough commands with respect to primitive speci?cation is maintained by
feedback. PassThrough may not occur between Begin and End. It has no effect
when the GL is not in feedback mode.
The state required for feedback is the pointer to the feedback array, the maxi-
mum number of values that may be placed there, and the feedback type. An over-
?ow ?ag is required to indicate whether the maximum allowable number of feed-
back values has been written; initially this ?ag is cleared. These state variables are
GL client state. Feedback also relies on the same mode ?ag as selection to indicate
whether the GL is in feedback, selection, or normal rendering mode.
5.4 Display Lists
A display list is simply a group of GL commands and arguments that has been
stored for subsequent execution. The GL may be instructed to process a particular
display list (possibly repeatedly) by providing a number that uniquely speci?es it.
Doing so causes the commands within the list to be executed just as if they were
given normally. The only exception pertains to commands that rely upon client

different data returned for vertices depending on the feedback type. LINE TOKEN
and LINE RESET TOKEN are identical except that the latter is returned only when
the line stipple is reset for that line segment.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.4. DISPLAYLISTS 239
state. When such a command is accumulated into the display list (that is, when
issued, not when executed), the client state in effect at that time applies to the com-
mand. Only server state is affected when the command is executed. As always,
pointers which are passed as arguments to commands are dereferenced when the
command is issued. (Vertex array pointers are dereferenced when the commands
ArrayElement, DrawArrays, DrawElements, or DrawRangeElements are ac-
cumulated into a display list.)
A display list is begun by calling
void NewList(uint n,enum mode );
n is a positive integer to which the display list that follows is assigned, and mode is a
symbolic constant that controls the behavior of the GL during display list creation.
If mode is COMPILE, then commands are not executed as they are placed in the
display list. If mode is COMPILE AND EXECUTE then commands are executed as
they are encountered, then placed in the display list. If n = 0, then the error
INVALID VALUE is generated.
After calling NewList all subsequent GL commands are placed in the display
list (in the order the commands are issued) until a call to
void EndList(void );
occurs, after which the GL returns to its normal command execution state. It is
only when EndList occurs that the speci?ed display list is actually associated with
the index indicated with NewList. The error INVALID OPERATION is generated
if EndList is called without a previous matching NewList, or if NewList is called
a second time before calling EndList. The error OUT OF MEMORY is generated if
EndList is called and the speci?ed display list cannot be stored because insuf?cient
memory is available. In this case GL implementations of revision 1.1 or greater
insure that no change is made to the previous contents of the display list, if any,
and that no other change is made to the GL state, except for the state changed by
execution of GL commands when the display list mode isCOMPILE AND EXECUTE.
Once de?ned, a display list is executed by calling
void CallList(uint n );
n gives the index of the display list to be called. This causes the commands saved
in the display list to be executed, in order, just as if they were issued without using
a display list. Ifn = 0, then the errorINVALID VALUE is generated.
The command
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.4. DISPLAYLISTS 240
void CallLists(sizei n,enum type,void *lists );
provides an ef?cient means for executing a number of display lists. n is an in-
teger indicating the number of display lists to be called, and lists is a pointer
that points to an array of offsets. Each offset is constructed as determined by
lists as follows. First, type may be one of the constants BYTE, UNSIGNED BYTE,
SHORT,UNSIGNED SHORT,INT,UNSIGNED INT, orFLOAT indicating that the ar-
ray pointed to by lists is an array of bytes, unsigned bytes, shorts, unsigned shorts,
integers, unsigned integers, or ?oats, respectively. In this case each offset is found
by simply converting each array element to an integer (?oating point values are
truncated). Further, type may be one of 2 BYTES, 3 BYTES, or 4 BYTES, indicat-
ing that the array contains sequences of 2, 3, or 4 unsigned bytes, in which case
each integer offset is constructed according to the following algorithm:
offset< 0
fori = 1 tob
offset< offset shifted left 8 bits
offset< offset+byte
advance to next byte in the array
b is 2, 3, or 4, as indicated by type. Ifn = 0, CallLists does nothing.
Each of the n constructed offsets is taken in order and added to a display list
base to obtain a display list number. For each number, the indicated display list is
executed. The base is set by calling
void ListBase(uint base );
to specify the offset.
Indicating a display list index that does not correspond to any display list has no
effect. CallList or CallLists may appear inside a display list. (If the mode supplied
to NewList is COMPILE AND EXECUTE, then the appropriate lists are executed,
but the CallList or CallLists, rather than those lists’ constituent commands, is
placed in the list under construction.) To avoid the possibility of in?nite recursion
resulting from display lists calling one another, an implementation dependent limit
is placed on the nesting level of display lists during display list execution. This
limit must be at least64.
Two commands are provided to manage display list indices.
uint GenLists(sizei s );
returns an integern such that the indicesn,...,n+s? 1 are previously unused (i.e.
there ares previously unused display list indices starting atn). GenLists also has
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.4. DISPLAYLISTS 241
the effect of creating an empty display list for each of the indicesn,...,n+s? 1,
so that these indices all become used. GenLists returns 0 if there is no group ofs
contiguous previously unused display list indices, or ifs = 0.
boolean IsList(uint list );
returnsTRUE if list is the index of some display list.
A contiguous group of display lists may be deleted by calling
void DeleteLists(uint list,sizei range );
where list is the index of the ?rst display list to be deleted and range is the number
of display lists to be deleted. All information about the display lists is lost, and the
indices become unused. Indices to which no display list corresponds are ignored.
Ifrange = 0, nothing happens.
Certain commands, when called while compiling a display list, are not com-
piled into the display list but are executed immediately. These commands fall in
several categories including
Display lists: GenLists and DeleteLists.
Render modes: FeedbackBuffer, SelectBuffer, and RenderMode.
Vertex arrays: ClientActiveTexture, ColorPointer, EdgeFlagPointer, Fog-
CoordPointer, IndexPointer, InterleavedArrays, NormalPointer, Secondary-
ColorPointer, TexCoordPointer, VertexAttribPointer, and VertexPointer.
Client state: EnableClientState, DisableClientState, EnableVertexAttrib-
Array, DisableVertexAttribArray, PushClientAttrib, and PopClientAttrib.
Pixels and textures: PixelStore, ReadPixels, GenTextures, DeleteTextures,
and AreTexturesResident.
Occlusion queries: GenQueries and DeleteQueries.
Vertex buffer objects: GenBuffers, DeleteBuffers, BindBuffer, BufferData,
BufferSubData, MapBuffer, and UnmapBuffer.
Program and shader objects: CreateProgram, CreateShader, DeletePro-
gram, DeleteShader, AttachShader, DetachShader, BindAttribLocation,
CompileShader, ShaderSource, LinkProgram, and ValidateProgram.
GL command stream management: Finish and Flush.
Other queries: All query commands whose names begin with Get and Is (see
chapter 6).
GL commands that source data from buffer objects dereference the buffer ob-
ject data in question at display list compile time, rather than encoding the buffer
ID and buffer offset into the display list. Only GL commands that are executed
immediately, rather than being compiled into a display list, are permitted to use a
buffer object as a data sink.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20045.5. FLUSHANDFINISH 242
TexImage3D, TexImage2D, TexImage1D, Histogram, and Col-
orTable are executed immediately when called with the correspond-
ing proxy arguments PROXY TEXTURE 3D; PROXY TEXTURE 2D or
PROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP; PROXY TEXTURE 1D; PROXY HISTOGRAM;
and PROXY COLOR TABLE, PROXY POST CONVOLUTION COLOR TABLE, or
PROXY POST COLOR MATRIX COLOR TABLE.
When a program object is in use, a display list may be executed whose vertex
attribute calls do not match up exactly with what is expected by the vertex shader
contained in that program object. Handling of this mismatch is described in sec-
tion 2.15.3.
Display lists require one bit of state to indicate whether a GL command should
be executed immediately or placed in a display list. In the initial state, commands
are executed immediately. If the bit indicates display list creation, an index is
required to indicate the current display list being de?ned. Another bit indicates,
during display list creation, whether or not commands should be executed as they
are compiled into the display list. One integer is required for the current ListBase
setting; its initial value is zero. Finally, state must be maintained to indicate which
integers are currently in use as display list indices. In the initial state, no indices
are in use.
5.5 Flush and Finish
The command
void Flush(void );
indicates that all commands that have previously been sent to the GL must complete
in ?nite time.
The command
void Finish(void );
forces all previous GL commands to complete. Finish does not return until all
effects from previously issued commands on GL client and server state and the
framebuffer are fully realized.
5.6 Hints
Certain aspects of GL behavior, when there is room for variation, may be controlled
with hints. A hint is speci?ed using

a symbolic constant indicating what type of behavior is desired. The possible
targets are described in table 5.3; for each target, hint must be one of FASTEST,
indicating that the most ef?cient option should be chosen;NICEST, indicating that
the highest quality option should be chosen; andDONT CARE, indicating no prefer-
ence in the matter.
For the texture compression hint, a hint ofFASTEST indicates that texture im-
ages should be compressed as quickly as possible, while NICEST indicates that
the texture images be compressed with as little image degradation as possible.
FASTEST should be used for one-time texture compression, and NICEST should
be used if the compression results are to be retrieved by GetCompressedTexIm-
age (section 6.1.4) for reuse.
The interpretation of hints is implementation dependent. An implementation
may ignore them entirely.
The initial value of all hints isDONT CARE.

State and State Requests
The state required to describe the GL machine is enumerated in section 6.2. Most
state is set through the calls described in previous chapters, and can be queried
using the calls described in section 6.1.
6.1 Querying GL State
6.1.1 Simple Queries
Much of the GL state is completely identi?ed by symbolic constants. The values
of these state variables can be obtained using a set of Get commands. There are
four commands for obtaining simple state variables:
void GetBooleanv(enum value,boolean *data );
void GetIntegerv(enum value,int *data );
void GetFloatv(enum value,float *data );
void GetDoublev(enum value,double *data );
The commands obtain boolean, integer, ?oating-point, or double-precision state
variables. value is a symbolic constant indicating the state variable to return. data
is a pointer to a scalar or array of the indicated type in which to place the returned
data. In addition
boolean IsEnabled(enum value );
can be used to determine if value is currently enabled (as with Enable) or disabled.
2446.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 245
6.1.2 Data Conversions
If a Get command is issued that returns value types different from the type of the
value being obtained, a type conversion is performed. If GetBooleanv is called,
a ?oating-point or integer value converts to FALSE if and only if it is zero (oth-
erwise it converts to TRUE). If GetIntegerv (or any of the Get commands below)
is called, a boolean value is interpreted as either 1 or 0, and a ?oating-point value
is rounded to the nearest integer, unless the value is an RGBA color component,
a DepthRange value, a depth buffer clear value, or a normal coordinate. In these
cases, the Get command converts the ?oating-point value to an integer according
the INT entry of table 4.7; a value not in [? 1,1] converts to an unde?ned value.
If GetFloatv is called, a boolean value is interpreted as either 1.0 or 0.0, an in-
teger is coerced to ?oating-point, and a double-precision ?oating-point value is
converted to single-precision. Analogous conversions are carried out in the case of
GetDoublev. If a value is so large in magnitude that it cannot be represented with
the requested type, then the nearest value representable using the requested type is
returned.
Unless otherwise indicated, multi-valued state variables return their multiple
values in the same order as they are given as arguments to the commands that set
them. For instance, the two DepthRange parameters are returned in the order n
followed by f. Similarly, points for evaluator maps are returned in the order that
they appeared when passed to Map1. Map2 returnsR in the [(uorder)i+j]th
ij
block of values (see page 228 fori,j, uorder, andR ).
ij
Matrices may be queried and returned in transposed form by calling Get-
Booleanv, GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, and GetDoublev with pname set to
one of TRANSPOSE MODELVIEW MATRIX, TRANSPOSE PROJECTION MATRIX,
TRANSPOSE TEXTURE MATRIX, orTRANSPOSE COLOR MATRIX. The effect of
GetFloatv(TRANSPOSE MODELVIEW MATRIX,m);
is the same as the effect of the command sequence
GetFloatv(MODELVIEW MATRIX,m);
T
m =m ;
Similar conversions occur when queryingTRANSPOSE PROJECTION MATRIX,
TRANSPOSE TEXTURE MATRIX, andTRANSPOSE COLOR MATRIX.
Most texture state variables are quali?ed by the value of ACTIVE TEXTURE
to determine which server texture state vector is queried. Client texture
state variables such as texture coordinate array pointers are quali?ed by
the value of CLIENT ACTIVE TEXTURE. Tables 6.5, 6.6, 6.9, 6.15, 6.18,
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 246
and 6.33 indicate those state variables which are quali?ed by ACTIVE TEXTURE
or CLIENT ACTIVE TEXTURE during state queries. Queries
of texture state variables corresponding to texture coordinate processing
units (namely, TexGen state and enables, and matrices) will generate an
INVALID OPERATION error if the value of ACTIVE TEXTURE is greater than or
equal to MAX TEXTURE COORDS. All other texture state queries will result in an
INVALID OPERATION error if the value of ACTIVE TEXTURE is greater than or
equal toMAX COMBINED TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS.
6.1.3 Enumerated Queries
Other commands exist to obtain state variables that are identi?ed by a category
(clip plane, light, material, etc.) as well as a symbolic constant. These are
void GetClipPlane(enum plane,double eqn[4] );
void GetLight{if}v(enum light,enum value,T data );
void GetMaterial{if}v(enum face,enum value,T data );
void GetTexEnv{if}v(enum env,enum value,T data );
void GetTexGen{ifd}v(enum coord,enum value,T data );
void GetTexParameter{if}v(enum target,enum value,
T data );
void GetTexLevelParameter{if}v(enum target,int lod,
enum value,T data );
void GetPixelMap{ui us f}v(enum map,T data );
void GetMap{ifd}v(enum map,enum value,T data );
void GetBufferParameteriv(enum target,enum value,
T data );
GetClipPlane always returns four double-precision values in eqn; these are the
coef?cients of the plane equation of plane in eye coordinates (these coordinates
are those that were computed when the plane was speci?ed).
GetLight places information about value (a symbolic constant) for light (also a
symbolic constant) in data. POSITION orSPOT DIRECTION returns values in eye
coordinates (again, these are the coordinates that were computed when the position
or direction was speci?ed).
GetMaterial, GetTexGen, GetTexEnv, GetTexParameter, and GetBuffer-
Parameter are similar to GetLight, placing information about value for the tar-
get indicated by their ?rst argument into data. The face argument to GetMa-
terial must be either FRONT or BACK, indicating the front or back material, re-
spectively. The env argument to GetTexEnv must be either TEXTURE ENV or
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 247
TEXTURE FILTER CONTROL. The coord argument to GetTexGen must be one of
S, T, R, or Q. For GetTexGen, EYE LINEAR coef?cients are returned in the eye
coordinates that were computed when the plane was speci?ed; OBJECT LINEAR
coef?cients are returned in object coordinates.
GetTexParameter
parameter target may be one of TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, or
TEXTURE CUBE MAP, indicating the currently bound one-, two-, three-dimensional,
or cube map texture object. GetTexLevelParameter parameter target may be one
of TEXTURE 1D, TEXTURE 2D, TEXTURE 3D, TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE X, TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Y,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Y, TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Z,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Z, PROXY TEXTURE 1D, PROXY TEXTURE 2D,
PROXY TEXTURE 3D, orPROXY TEXTURE CUBE MAP, indicating the one-, two-, or
three-dimensional texture object, or one of the six distinct 2D images making up
the cube map texture object or one-, two-, three-dimensional, or cube map proxy
state vector. Note that TEXTURE CUBE MAP is not a valid target parameter for
GetTexLevelParameter, because it does not specify a particular cube map face.
value is a symbolic value indicating which texture parameter is to be obtained.
For GetTexParameter, value must be either TEXTURE RESIDENT, or one of the
symbolic values in table 3.19. The lod argument to GetTexLevelParameter de-
termines which level-of-detail’s state is returned. If the lod argument is less than
zero or if it is larger than the maximum allowable level-of-detail then the error
INVALID VALUE occurs.
For texture images with uncompressed internal formats, queries of
value of TEXTURE RED SIZE, TEXTURE GREEN SIZE, TEXTURE BLUE SIZE,
TEXTURE ALPHA SIZE, TEXTURE LUMINANCE SIZE, TEXTURE DEPTH SIZE,
and TEXTURE INTENSITY SIZE return the actual resolutions of the stored im-
age array components, not the resolutions speci?ed when the image array was
de?ned. For texture images with a compressed internal format, the resolutions
returned specify the component resolution of an uncompressed internal format that
produces an image of roughly the same quality as the compressed image in ques-
tion. Since the quality of the implementation’s compression algorithm is likely
data-dependent, the returned component sizes should be treated only as rough ap-
proximations.
Querying value TEXTURE COMPRESSED IMAGE SIZE returns the
size (in ubytes) of the compressed texture image that would be
returned by GetCompressedTexImage (section 6.1.4). Querying
TEXTURE COMPRESSED IMAGE SIZE is not allowed on texture images with
an uncompressed internal format or on proxy targets and will result in an
INVALID OPERATION error if attempted.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 248
Queries of value TEXTURE WIDTH, TEXTURE HEIGHT, TEXTURE DEPTH, and
TEXTURE BORDER return the width, height, depth, and border as speci?ed when
the image array was created. The internal format of the image array is queried
as TEXTURE INTERNAL FORMAT, or as TEXTURE COMPONENTS for compatibility
with GL version 1.0.
For GetPixelMap, the map must be a map name from table 3.3. For GetMap,
map must be one of the map types described in section 5.1, and value must be one
ofORDER,COEFF, orDOMAIN.
6.1.4 Texture Queries
The command
void GetTexImage(enum tex,int lod,enum format,
enum type,void *img );
is used to obtain texture images. It is somewhat different from the other get com-
mands; tex is a symbolic value indicating which texture (or texture face in the case
of a cube map texture target name) is to be obtained. TEXTURE 1D,TEXTURE 2D,
and TEXTURE 3D indicate a one-, two-, or three-dimensional texture respectively,
while TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE X, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE X,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Y, TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Y,
TEXTURE CUBE MAP POSITIVE Z, and TEXTURE CUBE MAP NEGATIVE Z indi-
cate the respective face of a cube map texture. lod is a level-of-detail number,
format is a pixel format from table 3.6, type is a pixel type from table 3.5, and img
is a pointer to a block of memory.
GetTexImage obtains component groups from a texture image with the indi-
cated level-of-detail. The components are assigned among R, G, B, and A ac-
cording to table 6.1, starting with the ?rst group in the ?rst row, and continuing
by obtaining groups in order from each row and proceeding from the ?rst row to
the last, and from the ?rst image to the last for three-dimensional textures. These
groups are then packed and placed in client memory. No pixel transfer operations
are performed on this image, but pixel storage modes that are applicable to Read-
Pixels are applied.
For three-dimensional textures, pixel storage operations are applied as if the
image were two-dimensional, except that the additional pixel storage state values
PACK IMAGE HEIGHT and PACK SKIP IMAGES are applied. The correspondence
of texels to memory locations is as de?ned for TexImage3D in section 3.8.1.
The row length, number of rows, image depth, and number of images are de-
termined by the size of the texture image (including any borders). Calling Get-
TexImage with lod less than zero or larger than the maximum allowable causes

the error INVALID VALUE Calling GetTexImage with format of COLOR INDEX,
STENCIL INDEX, orDEPTH COMPONENT causes the errorINVALID ENUM.
The command
void GetCompressedTexImage(enum target,int lod,
void *img );
is used to obtain texture images stored in compressed form. The parameters target,
lod, and img are interpreted in the same manner as in GetTexImage. When called,
GetCompressedTexImage writesTEXTURE COMPRESSED IMAGE SIZEubytes
of compressed image data to the memory pointed to by img. The compressed
image data is formatted according to the de?nition of the texture’s internal format.
All pixel storage and pixel transfer modes are ignored when returning a compressed
texture image.
Calling GetCompressedTexImage with an lod value less than zero or greater
than the maximum allowable causes anINVALID VALUE error. Calling GetCom-
pressedTexImage with a texture image stored with an uncompressed internal for-
mat causes anINVALID OPERATION error.
The command
boolean IsTexture(uint texture );
returnsTRUE if texture is the name of a texture object. If texture is zero, or is a non-
zero value that is not the name of a texture object, or if an error condition occurs,
IsTexture returnsFALSE. A name returned by GenTextures, but not yet bound, is
not the name of a texture object.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 250
6.1.5 Stipple Query
The command
void GetPolygonStipple(void *pattern );
obtains the polygon stipple. The pattern is packed into memory according to the
procedure given in section 4.3.2 for ReadPixels; it is as if the height and width
passed to that command were both equal to 32, the type were BITMAP, and the
format wereCOLOR INDEX.
6.1.6 Color Matrix Query
The scale and bias variables are queried using GetFloatv with pname set
to the appropriate variable name. The top matrix on the color matrix
stack is returned by GetFloatv called with pname set to COLOR MATRIX or
TRANSPOSE COLOR MATRIX. The depth of the color matrix stack, and the maxi-
mum depth of the color matrix stack, are queried with GetIntegerv, setting pname
toCOLOR MATRIX STACK DEPTH andMAX COLOR MATRIX STACK DEPTH respec-
tively.
6.1.7 Color Table Query
The current contents of a color table are queried using
void GetColorTable(enum target,enum format,enum type,
void *table );
target must be one of the regular color table names listed in table 3.4. format and
type accept the same values as do the corresponding parameters of GetTexImage.
The one-dimensional color table image is returned to client memory starting at
table. No pixel transfer operations are performed on this image, but pixel storage
modes that are applicable to ReadPixels are performed. Color components that are
requested in the speci?ed format, but which are not included in the internal format
of the color lookup table, are returned as zero. The assignments of internal color
components to the components requested by format are described in table 6.1.
The functions
void GetColorTableParameter{if}v(enum target,
enum pname,T params );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 251
are used for integer and ?oating point query.
target must be one of the regular or proxy color table names listed
in table 3.4. pname is one of COLOR TABLE SCALE, COLOR TABLE BIAS,
COLOR TABLE FORMAT, COLOR TABLE WIDTH, COLOR TABLE RED SIZE,
COLOR TABLE GREEN SIZE, COLOR TABLE BLUE SIZE,
COLOR TABLE ALPHA SIZE, COLOR TABLE LUMINANCE SIZE,
or COLOR TABLE INTENSITY SIZE. The value of the speci?ed parameter is re-
turned in params.
6.1.8 Convolution Query
The current contents of a convolution ?lter image are queried with the command
void GetConvolutionFilter(enum target,enum format,
enum type,void *image );
target must be CONVOLUTION 1D or CONVOLUTION 2D. format and type accept
the same values as do the corresponding parameters of GetTexImage. The one-
dimensional or two-dimensional images is returned to client memory starting at
image. Pixel processing and component mapping are identical to those of GetTex-
Image.
The current contents of a separable ?lter image are queried using
void GetSeparableFilter(enum target,enum format,
enum type,void *row,void *column,void *span );
target must be SEPARABLE 2D. format and type accept the same values as do the
corresponding parameters of GetTexImage. The row and column images are re-
turned to client memory starting at row and column respectively. span is currently
unused. Pixel processing and component mapping are identical to those of Get-
TexImage.
The functions
void GetConvolutionParameter{if}v(enum target,
enum pname,T params );
are used for integer and ?oating point query. target must be
CONVOLUTION 1D, CONVOLUTION 2D, or SEPARABLE 2D. pname is
one of CONVOLUTION BORDER COLOR, CONVOLUTION BORDER MODE,
CONVOLUTION FILTER SCALE, CONVOLUTION FILTER BIAS,
CONVOLUTION FORMAT, CONVOLUTION WIDTH, CONVOLUTION HEIGHT,
MAX CONVOLUTION WIDTH, or MAX CONVOLUTION HEIGHT. The value of the
speci?ed parameter is returned in params.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 252
6.1.9 Histogram Query
The current contents of the histogram table are queried using
void GetHistogram(enum target,boolean reset,
enum format,enum type,void* values );
target must beHISTOGRAM. type and format accept the same values as do the cor-
responding parameters of GetTexImage. The one-dimensional histogram table
image is returned to values. Pixel processing and component mapping are identi-
cal to those of GetTexImage, except that instead of applying the Final Conversion
pixel storage mode, component values are simply clamped to the range of the target
data type.
If reset is TRUE, then all counters of all elements of the histogram are reset to
zero. Counters are reset whether returned or not.
No counters are modi?ed if reset isFALSE.
Calling
void ResetHistogram(enum target );
resets all counters of all elements of the histogram table to zero. target must be
HISTOGRAM.
It is not an error to reset or query the contents of a histogram table with zero
entries.
The functions
void GetHistogramParameter{if}v(enum target,
enum pname,T params );
are used for integer and ?oating point query. target must be HISTOGRAM or
PROXY HISTOGRAM. pname is one of HISTOGRAM FORMAT, HISTOGRAM WIDTH,
HISTOGRAM RED SIZE, HISTOGRAM GREEN SIZE, HISTOGRAM BLUE SIZE,
HISTOGRAM ALPHA SIZE, or HISTOGRAM LUMINANCE SIZE. pname may be
HISTOGRAM SINK only for target HISTOGRAM. The value of the speci?ed
parameter is returned in params.
6.1.10 Minmax Query
The current contents of the minmax table are queried using
void GetMinmax(enum target,boolean reset,enum format,
enum type,void* values );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 253
target must be MINMAX. type and format accept the same values as do the corre-
sponding parameters of GetTexImage. A one-dimensional image of width 2 is
returned to values. Pixel processing and component mapping are identical to those
of GetTexImage.
If reset is TRUE, then each minimum value is reset to the maximum repre-
sentable value, and each maximum value is reset to the minimum representable
value. All values are reset, whether returned or not.
No values are modi?ed if reset isFALSE.
Calling
void ResetMinmax(enum target );
resets all minimum and maximum values of target to to their maximum and mini-
mum representable values, respectively, target must beMINMAX.
The functions
void GetMinmaxParameter{if}v(enum target,enum pname,
T params );
are used for integer and ?oating point query. target must be MINMAX. pname is
MINMAX FORMAT or MINMAX SINK. The value of the speci?ed parameter is re-
turned in params.
6.1.11 Pointer and String Queries
The command
void GetPointerv(enum pname,void **params );
obtains the pointer or pointers named pname in the
array params. The possible values for pname are
SELECTION BUFFER POINTER, FEEDBACK BUFFER POINTER,
VERTEX ARRAY POINTER, NORMAL ARRAY POINTER, COLOR ARRAY POINTER,
SECONDARY COLOR ARRAY POINTER, INDEX ARRAY POINTER,
TEXTURE COORD ARRAY POINTER, FOG COORD ARRAY POINTER, and
EDGE FLAG ARRAY POINTER. Each returns a single pointer value.
Finally,
ubyte *GetString(enum name );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 254
returns a pointer to a static string describing some aspect of the current GL con-
1
nection . The possible values for name are VENDOR, RENDERER, VERSION,
SHADING LANGUAGE VERSION, and EXTENSIONS. The format of the RENDERER
and VENDOR strings is implementation dependent. The EXTENSIONS string con-
tains a space separated list of extension names (the extension names themselves do
not contain any spaces). TheVERSION andSHADING LANGUAGE VERSION strings
are laid out as follows:
<version number><space><vendor-speci?c information>
The version number is either of the form major number.minor number or ma-
jor number.minor number.release number, where the numbers all have one or
more digits. The release number and vendor speci?c information are optional.
However, if present, then they pertain to the server and their format and contents
are implementation dependent.
GetString returns the version number (returned in the VERSION string) and
the extension names (returned in the EXTENSIONS string) that can be supported
on the connection. Thus, if the client and server support different versions and/or
extensions, a compatible version and list of extensions is returned.
6.1.12 Occlusion Queries
The command
boolean IsQuery(uint id );
returnsTRUE if id is the name of a query object. If id is zero, or if id is a non-zero
value that is not the name of a query object, IsQuery returnsFALSE.
Information about a query target can be queried with the command
void GetQueryiv(enum target,enum pname,int *params );
If pname isCURRENT QUERY, the name of the currently active query for target, or
zero if no query is active, will be placed in params.
If pname isQUERY COUNTER BITS, the number of bits in the counter for target
will be placed in params. The number of query counter bits may be zero, in which
case the counter contains no useful information. Otherwise, the minimum number
1
Applications making copies of these static strings should never use a ?xed-length buffer, because
the strings may grow unpredictably between releases, resulting in buffer over?ow when copying.
This is particularly true of theEXTENSIONS string, which has become extremely long in some
GL implementations.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 255
of bits allowed is a function of the implementation’s maximum viewport dimen-
sions (MAX VIEWPORT DIMS). In this case, the counter must be able to represent
at least two overdraws for every pixel in the viewport The formula to compute the
allowable minimum value (where n is the minimum number of bits) is:
n = min{32,dlog (maxViewportWidth? maxViewportHeight? 2)e}
2
The state of a query object can be queried with the commands
void GetQueryObjectiv(uint id,enum pname,
int *params );
void GetQueryObjectuiv(uint id,enum pname,
uint *params );
If id is not the name of a query object, or if the query object named by id is currently
active, then anINVALID OPERATION error is generated.
If pname is QUERY RESULT, then the query object’s result value is placed in
params. If the number of query counter bits for target is zero, then the result value
is always 0.
There may be an indeterminate delay before the above query returns. If
pname isQUERY RESULT AVAILABLE, it immediately returnsFALSE if such a de-
lay would be required, TRUE otherwise. It must always be true that if any query
object returns result available of TRUE, all queries issued prior to that query must
also returnTRUE.
Querying the state for any given query object forces that occlusion query to
complete within a ?nite amount of time.
If multiple queries are issued on the same target and id prior to calling Get-
QueryObject[u]iv, the result returned will always be from the last query issued.
The results from any queries before the last one will be lost if the results are not
retrieved before starting a new query on the same target and id.
6.1.13 Buffer Object Queries
The command
boolean IsBuffer(uint buffer );
returnsTRUE if buffer is the name of an buffer object. If buffer is zero, or if buffer is
a non-zero value that is not the name of an buffer object, IsBuffer returnsFALSE.
The command
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 256
void GetBufferSubData(enum target,intptr offset,
sizeiptr size,void *data );
queries the data contents of a buffer object. target is ARRAY BUFFER or
ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER. offset and size indicate the range of data in the buffer
object that is to be queried, in terms of basic machine units. data speci?es a region
of client memory, size basic machine units in length, into which the data is to be
retrieved.
An error is generated if GetBufferSubData is executed for a buffer object that
is currently mapped.
While the data store of a buffer object is mapped, the pointer to the data store
can be queried by calling
void GetBufferPointerv(enum target,enum pname,
void **params );
with target set to ARRAY BUFFER or ELEMENT ARRAY BUFFER and pname set to
BUFFER MAP POINTER. The single buffer map pointer is returned in *params.
GetBufferPointerv returns the NULL pointer value if the buffer’s data store is not
currently mapped, or if the requesting client did not map the buffer object’s data
store, and the implementation is unable to support mappings on multiple clients.
6.1.14 Shader and Program Queries
State stored in shader or program objects can be queried by commands that ac-
cept shader or program object names. These commands will generate the error
INVALID VALUE if the provided name is not the name of either a shader or pro-
gram object andINVALID OPERATION if the provided name identi?es a shader of
the other type. If an error is generated, variables used to hold return values are not
modi?ed.
The command
boolean IsShader(uint shader );
returns TRUE if shader is the name of a shader object. If shader is zero, or a non-
zero value that is not the name of a shader object, IsShader returns FALSE. No
error is generated if shader is not a valid shader object name.
The command
void GetShaderiv(uint shader,enum pname,int *params );
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 257
returns properties of the shader object named shader in params. The parameter
value to return is speci?ed by pname.
If pname is SHADER TYPE, VERTEX SHADER is returned if shader is a ver-
tex shader object, and FRAGMENT SHADER is returned if shader is a fragment
shader object. If pname is DELETE STATUS, TRUE is returned if the shader
has been ?agged for deletion and FALSE is returned otherwise. If pname is
COMPILE STATUS, TRUE is returned if the shader was last compiled sucessfully,
and FALSE is returned otherwise. If pname is INFO LOG LENGTH, the length of
the info log, including a null terminator, is returned. If there is no info log, zero
is returned. If pname isSHADER SOURCE LENGTH, the length of the concatenation
of the source strings making up the shader source, including a null terminator, is
returned. If no source has been de?ned, zero is returned.
The command
boolean IsProgram(uint program );
returns TRUE if program is the name of a program object. If program is zero,
or a non-zero value that is not the name of a program object, IsProgram returns
FALSE. No error is generated if program is not a valid program object name.
The command
void GetProgramiv(uint program,enum pname,
int *params );
returns properties of the program object named program in params. The parameter
value to return is speci?ed by pname.
If pname is DELETE STATUS, TRUE is returned if the shader has been ?agged
for deletion andFALSE is returned otherwise. If pname isLINK STATUS,TRUE is
returned if the shader was last compiled sucessfully, and FALSE is returned oth-
erwise. If pname is VALIDATE STATUS, TRUE is returned if the last call to Vali-
dateProgram with program was successful, and FALSE is returned otherwise. If
pname isINFO LOG LENGTH, the length of the info log, including a null terminator,
is returned. If there is no info log, 0 is returned. If pname isATTACHED SHADERS,
the number of objects attached is returned. If pname is ACTIVE ATTRIBUTES,
the number of active attributes in program is returned. If no active attributes ex-
ist, 0 is returned. If pname is ACTIVE ATTRIBUTE MAX LENGTH, the length of
the longest active attribute name, including a null terminator, is returned. If no
active attributes exist, 0 is returned. If pname is ACTIVE UNIFORMS, the number
of active uniforms is returned. If no active uniforms exist, 0 is returned. If pname
isACTIVE UNIFORM MAX LENGTH, the length of the longest active uniform name,
including a null terminator, is returned. If no active uniforms exist, 0 is returned.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 258
The command
void GetAttachedShaders(uint program,sizei maxCount,
sizei *count,uint *shaders );
returns the names of shader objects attached to program in shaders. The actual
number of shader names written into shaders is returned in count. If no shaders are
attached, count is set to zero. If count is NULL then it is ignored. The maximum
number of shader names that may be written into shaders is speci?ed by maxCount.
The number of objects attached to program is given by can be queried by calling
GetProgramiv withATTACHED SHADERS.
A string that contains information about the last compilation attempt on a
shader object or last link or validation attempt on a program object, called the
info log, can be obtained with the commands
void GetShaderInfoLog(uint shader,sizei bufSize,
sizei *length,char *infoLog );
void GetProgramInfoLog(uint program,sizei bufSize,
sizei *length,char *infoLog );
These commands return the info log string in infoLog. This string will be null
terminated. The actual number of characters written into infoLog, excluding the
null terminator, is returned in length. If length isNULL, then no length is returned.
The maximum number of characters that may be written into infoLog, including
the null terminator, is speci?ed by bufSize. The number of characters in the info
log can be queried with GetShaderiv or GetProgramiv withINFO LOG LENGTH.
If program is a shader object, the returned info log will either be an empty string
or it will contain information about the last compilation attempt for that object. If
program is a program object, the returned info log will either be an empty string or
it will contain information about the last link attempt or last validation attempt for
that object.
The info log is typically only useful during application development and an
application should not expect different GL implementations to produce identical
info logs.
The command
void GetShaderSource(uint shader,sizei bufSize,
sizei *length,char *source );
returns in source the string making up the source code for the shader object shader.
The string source will be null terminated. The actual number of characters written
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 259
into source, excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length isNULL,
no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into
source, including the null terminator, is speci?ed by bufSize. The string source is
a concatenation of the strings passed to the GL using ShaderSource. The length
of this concatenation is given bySHADER SOURCE LENGTH, which can be queried
with GetShaderiv.
The commands
void GetVertexAttribdv(uint index,enum pname,
double *params );
void GetVertexAttribfv(uint index,enum pname,
float *params );
void GetVertexAttribiv(uint index,enum pname,
int *params );
obtain the vertex attribute state named by pname for the generic vertex attribute
numbered index and places the information in the array params. pname must
be one of VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY ENABLED, VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY SIZE,
VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY STRIDE, VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY TYPE,
VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY NORMALIZED, or CURRENT VERTEX ATTRIB. Note that
all the queries except CURRENT VERTEX ATTRIB return client state. The
error INVALID VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to
MAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
All butCURRENT VERTEX ATTRIB return information about generic vertex at-
tribute arrays. The enable state of a generic vertex attribute array is set by the
command EnableVertexAttribArray and cleared by DisableVertexAttribArray.
The size, stride, type and normalized ?ag are set by the command VertexAttrib-
Pointer. The query CURRENT VERTEX ATTRIB returns the current value for the
generic attribute index. In this case the error INVALID OPERATION is generated
if index is zero, as there is no current value for generic attribute zero.
The command
void GetVertexAttribPointerv(uint index,enum pname,
void **pointer );
obtains the pointer named pname for vertex attribute numbered index
and places the information in the array pointer. pname must be
VERTEX ATTRIB ARRAY POINTER. TheINVALID VALUE error is generated if in-
dex is greater than or equal toMAX VERTEX ATTRIBS.
The commands
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 260
void GetUniformfv(uint program,int location,
float *params );
void GetUniformiv(uint program,int location,
int *params );
return the value or values of the uniform at location location for program object
program in the array params. The type of the uniform at location determines the
number of values returned. The error INVALID OPERATION is generated if pro-
gram has not been linked successfully, or if location is not a valid location for
program. In order to query the values of an array of uniforms, a GetUniform*
command needs to be issued for each array element. If the uniform queried is a
matrix, the values of the matrix are returned in column major order. If an error
occurred, the return parameter params will be unmodi?ed.
6.1.15 Saving and Restoring State
Besides providing a means to obtain the values of state variables, the GL also
provides a means to save and restore groups of state variables. The PushAttrib,
PushClientAttrib, PopAttrib and PopClientAttrib commands are used for this
purpose. The commands
void PushAttrib(bitfield mask );
void PushClientAttrib(bitfield mask );
take a bitwise OR of symbolic constants indicating which groups of state variables
to push onto an attribute stack. PushAttrib uses a server attribute stack while
PushClientAttrib uses a client attribute stack. Each constant refers to a group
of state variables. The classi?cation of each variable into a group is indicated
in the following tables of state variables. The error STACK OVERFLOW is gener-
ated if PushAttrib or PushClientAttrib is executed while the corresponding stack
depth is MAX ATTRIB STACK DEPTH or MAX CLIENT ATTRIB STACK DEPTH re-
spectively. Bits set in mask that do not correspond to an attribute group are ignored.
The special mask valuesALL ATTRIB BITS andCLIENT ALL ATTRIB BITS may
be used to push all stackable server and client state, respectively.
The commands
void PopAttrib(void );
void PopClientAttrib(void );
reset the values of those state variables that were saved with the last corresponding
PushAttrib or PopClientAttrib. Those not saved remain unchanged. The er-
rorSTACK UNDERFLOW is generated if PopAttrib or PopClientAttrib is executed
while the respective stack is empty.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 20046.1. QUERYINGGLSTATE 261
table 6.2 shows the attribute groups with their corresponding symbolic constant
names and stacks.
When PushAttrib is called with TEXTURE BIT set, the priorities, border col-
ors, ?lter modes, and wrap modes of the currently bound texture objects, as well
as the current texture bindings and enables, are pushed onto the attribute stack.
(Unbound texture objects are not pushed or restored.) When an attribute set that
includes texture information is popped, the bindings and enables are ?rst restored
to their pushed values, then the bound texture objects’ priorities, border colors,
?lter modes, and wrap modes are restored to their pushed values.
Operations on attribute groups push or pop texture state within that group for
all texture units. When state for a group is pushed, all state corresponding to
TEXTURE0 is pushed ?rst, followed by state corresponding to TEXTURE1, and so
on up to and including the state corresponding to TEXTUREk where k + 1 is the
value of MAX TEXTURE UNITS. When state for a group is popped, texture state is
restored in the opposite order that it was pushed, starting with state corresponding
to TEXTUREk and ending with TEXTURE0. Identical rules are observed for client
texture state push and pop operations. Matrix stacks are never pushed or popped
with PushAttrib, PushClientAttrib, PopAttrib, or PopClientAttrib.
The depth of each attribute stack is implementation dependent but must be at
least 16. The state required for each attribute stack is potentially 16 copies of each
state variable, 16 masks indicating which groups of variables are stored in each
stack entry, and an attribute stack pointer. In the initial state, both attribute stacks
are empty.
In the tables that follow, a type is indicated for each variable. table 6.3 explains
these types. The type actually identi?es all state associated with the indicated
description; in certain cases only a portion of this state is returned. This is the
case with all matrices, where only the top entry on the stack is returned; with clip
planes, where only the selected clip plane is returned, with parameters describing
lights, where only the value pertaining to the selected light is returned; with tex-
tures, where only the selected texture or texture parameter is returned; and with
evaluator maps, where only the selected map is returned. Finally, a “–” in the at-
tribute column indicates that the indicated value is not included in any attribute
group (and thus can not be pushed or popped with PushAttrib, PushClientAttrib,
PopAttrib, or PopClientAttrib).
The M and m entries for initial minmax table values represent the maximum
and minimum possible representable values, respectively.

6.2 State Tables
The tables on the following pages indicate which state variables are obtained with
what commands. State variables that can be obtained using any of GetBooleanv,
GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, or GetDoublev are listed with just one of these com-
mands – the one that is most appropriate given the type of the data to be returned.
These state variables cannot be obtained using IsEnabled. However, state vari-
ables for which IsEnabled is listed as the query command can also be obtained
using GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, and GetDoublev. State variables
for which any other command is listed as the query command can be obtained only
by using that command.
State table entries which are required only by the imaging subset (see sec-
tion 3.6.2) are typeset against a gray background .

Invariance
The OpenGL speci?cation is not pixel exact. It therefore does not guarantee an ex-
act match between images produced by different GL implementations. However,
the speci?cation does specify exact matches, in some cases, for images produced
by the same implementation. The purpose of this appendix is to identify and pro-
vide justi?cation for those cases that require exact matches.
A.1 Repeatability
The obvious and most fundamental case is repeated issuance of a series of GL com-
mands. For any given GL and framebuffer state vector, and for any GL command,
the resulting GL and framebuffer state must be identical whenever the command is
executed on that initial GL and framebuffer state.
One purpose of repeatability is avoidance of visual artifacts when a double-
buffered scene is redrawn. If rendering is not repeatable, swapping between two
buffers rendered with the same command sequence may result in visible changes
in the image. Such false motion is distracting to the viewer. Another reason for
repeatability is testability.
Repeatability, while important, is a weak requirement. Given only repeata-
bility as a requirement, two scenes rendered with one (small) polygon changed
in position might differ at every pixel. Such a difference, while within the law
of repeatability, is certainly not within its spirit. Additional invariance rules are
desirable to ensure useful operation.
299A.2. MULTI-PASSALGORITHMS 300
A.2 Multi-pass Algorithms
Invariance is necessary for a whole set of useful multi-pass algorithms. Such al-
gorithms render multiple times, each time with a different GL mode vector, to
eventually produce a result in the framebuffer. Examples of these algorithms in-
clude:
• “Erasing” a primitive from the framebuffer by redrawing it, either in a dif-
ferent color or using the XOR logical operation.
• Using stencil operations to compute capping planes.
On the other hand, invariance rules can greatly increase the complexity of high-
performance implementations of the GL. Even the weak repeatability requirement
signi?cantly constrains a parallel implementation of the GL. Because GL imple-
mentations are required to implement ALL GL capabilities, not just a convenient
subset, those that utilize hardware acceleration are expected to alternate between
hardware and software modules based on the current GL mode vector. A strong
invariance requirement forces the behavior of the hardware and software modules
to be identical, something that may be very dif?cult to achieve (for example, if the
hardware does ?oating-point operations with different precision than the software).
What is desired is a compromise that results in many compliant, high-
performance implementations, and in many software vendors choosing to port to
OpenGL.
A.3 Invariance Rules
For a given instantiation of an OpenGL rendering context:
Rule 1 For any given GL and framebuffer state vector, and for any given GL com-
mand, the resulting GL and framebuffer state must be identical each time the com-
mand is executed on that initial GL and framebuffer state.
Rule 2 Changes to the following state values have no side effects (the use of any
other state value is not affected by the change):
Required:
• Framebuffer contents (all bitplanes)
• The color buffers enabled for writing
• The values of matrices other than the top-of-stack matrices
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004A.3. INVARIANCERULES 301
• Scissor parameters (other than enable)
• Writemasks (color, index, depth, stencil)
• Clear values (color, index, depth, stencil, accumulation)
? Current values (color, index, normal, texture coords, edge?ag)
? Current raster color, index and texture coordinates.
? Material properties (ambient, diffuse, specular, emission, shininess)
Strongly suggested:
• Matrix mode
• Matrix stack depths
• Alpha test parameters (other than enable)
• Stencil parameters (other than enable)
• Depth test parameters (other than enable)
• Blend parameters (other than enable)
• Logical operation parameters (other than enable)
• Pixel storage and transfer state
• Evaluator state (except as it affects the vertex data generated by the
evaluators)
• Polygon offset parameters (other than enables, and except as they affect
the depth values of fragments)
Corollary 1 Fragment generation is invariant with respect to the state values
marked with• in Rule 2.
Corollary 2 The window coordinates (x, y, and z) of generated fragments are also
invariant with respect to
Required:
• Current values (color, color index, normal, texture coords, edge?ag)
• Current raster color, color index, and texture coordinates
• Material properties (ambient, diffuse, specular, emission, shininess)
Rule 3 The arithmetic of each per-fragment operation is invariant except with re-
spect to parameters that directly control it (the parameters that control the alpha
test, for instance, are the alpha test enable, the alpha test function, and the alpha
test reference value).
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004A.4. WHATALLTHISMEANS 302
Corollary 3 Images rendered into different color buffers sharing the same frame-
buffer, either simultaneously or separately using the same command sequence, are
pixel identical.
Rule 4 The same vertex or fragment shader will produce the same result when
run multiple times with the same input. The wording ’the same shader’ means a
program object that is populated with the same source strings, which are compiled
and then linked, possibly multiple times, and which program object is then executed
using the same GL state vector.
Rule 5 All fragment shaders that either conditionally or unconditionally assign
gl FragCoord.z to gl FragDepth are depth-invariant with respect to each
other, for those fragments where the assignment to gl FragDepth actually is
done.
A.4 What All This Means
Hardware accelerated GL implementations are expected to default to software op-
eration when some GL state vectors are encountered. Even the weak repeatability
requirement means, for example, that OpenGL implementations cannot apply hys-
teresis to this swap, but must instead guarantee that a given mode vector implies
that a subsequent command always is executed in either the hardware or the soft-
ware machine.
The stronger invariance rules constrain when the switch from hardware to soft-
ware rendering can occur, given that the software and hardware renderers are not
pixel identical. For example, the switch can be made when blending is enabled or
disabled, but it should not be made when a change is made to the blending param-
eters.
Because ?oating point values may be represented using different formats in dif-
ferent renderers (hardware and software), many OpenGL state values may change
subtly when renderers are swapped. This is the type of state value change that Rule
1 seeks to avoid.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix B
Corollaries
The following observations are derived from the body and the other appendixes of
the speci?cation. Absence of an observation from this list in no way impugns its
veracity.
1. The CURRENT RASTER TEXTURE COORDS must be maintained correctly at
all times, including periods while texture mapping is not enabled, and when
the GL is in color index mode.
2. When requested, texture coordinates returned in feedback mode are always
valid, including periods while texture mapping is not enabled, and when the
GL is in color index mode.
3. The error semantics of upward compatible OpenGL revisions may change.
Otherwise, only additions can be made to upward compatible revisions.
4. GL query commands are not required to satisfy the semantics of the Flush
or the Finish commands. All that is required is that the queried state be con-
sistent with complete execution of all previously executed GL commands.
5. Application speci?ed point size and line width must be returned as speci?ed
when queried. Implementation dependent clamping affects the values only
while they are in use.
6. Bitmaps and pixel transfers do not cause selection hits.
7. The mask speci?ed as the third argument to StencilFunc affects the operands
of the stencil comparison function, but has no direct effect on the update of
the stencil buffer. The mask speci?ed by StencilMask has no effect on the
stencil comparison function; it limits the effect of the update of the stencil
buffer.
303304
8. Polygon shading is completed before the polygon mode is interpreted. If the
shade model isFLAT, all of the points or lines generated by a single polygon
will have the same color.
9. A display list is just a group of commands and arguments, so errors generated
by commands in a display list must be generated when the list is executed.
If the list is created inCOMPILE mode, errors should not be generated while
the list is being created.
10. RasterPos does not change the current raster index from its default value
in an RGBA mode GL context. Likewise, RasterPos does not change the
current raster color from its default value in a color index GL context. Both
the current raster index and the current raster color can be queried, however,
regardless of the color mode of the GL context.
11. A material property that is attached to the current color via ColorMaterial
always takes the value of the current color. Attempts to change that material
property via Material calls have no effect.
12. Material and ColorMaterial can be used to modify the RGBA material
properties, even in a color index context. Likewise, Material can be used to
modify the color index material properties, even in an RGBA context.
13. There is no atomicity requirement for OpenGL rendering commands, even
at the fragment level.
14. Because rasterization of non-antialiased polygons is point sampled, poly-
gons that have no area generate no fragments when they are rasterized in
FILL mode, and the fragments generated by the rasterization of “narrow”
polygons may not form a continuous array.
15. OpenGL does not force left- or right-handedness on any of its coordinates
systems. Consider, however, the following conditions: (1) the object coordi-
nate system is right-handed; (2) the only commands used to manipulate the
model-view matrix are Scale (with positive scaling values only), Rotate, and
Translate; (3) exactly one of either Frustum or Ortho is used to set the pro-
jection matrix; (4) the near value is less than the far value for DepthRange.
If these conditions are all satis?ed, then the eye coordinate system is right-
handed and the clip, normalized device, and window coordinate systems are
left-handed.
16. ColorMaterial has no effect on color index lighting.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004305
17. (No pixel dropouts or duplicates.) Let two polygons share an identical edge
(that is, there exist vertices A and B of an edge of one polygon, and vertices
C and D of an edge of the other polygon, and the coordinates of vertex A
(resp. B) are identical to those of vertex C (resp. D), and the state of the the
coordinate transfomations is identical when A, B, C, and D are speci?ed).
Then, when the fragments produced by rasterization of both polygons are
taken together, each fragment intersecting the interior of the shared edge is
produced exactly once.
18. OpenGL state continues to be modi?ed in FEEDBACK mode and in SELECT
mode. The contents of the framebuffer are not modi?ed.
19. The current raster position, the user de?ned clip planes, the spot directions
and the light positions for LIGHTi, and the eye planes for texgen are trans-
formed when they are speci?ed. They are not transformed during a PopAt-
trib, or when copying a context.
20. Dithering algorithms may be different for different components. In particu-
lar, alpha may be dithered differently from red, green, or blue, and an imple-
mentation may choose to not dither alpha at all.
21. For any GL and framebuffer state, and for any group of GL commands and
arguments, the resulting GL and framebuffer state is identical whether the
GL commands and arguments are executed normally or from a display list.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix C
Version 1.1
OpenGL version 1.1 is the ?rst revision since the original version 1.0 was released
on 1 July 1992. Version 1.1 is upward compatible with version 1.0, meaning that
any program that runs with a 1.0 GL implementation will also run unchanged with
a 1.1 GL implementation. Several additions were made to the GL, especially to
the texture mapping capabilities, but also to the geometry and fragment operations.
Following are brief descriptions of each addition.
C.1 Vertex Array
Arrays of vertex data may be transferred to the GL with many fewer commands
than were previously necessary. Six arrays are de?ned, one each storing vertex
positions, normal coordinates, colors, color indices, texture coordinates, and edge
?ags. The arrays may be speci?ed and enabled independently, or one of the pre-
de?ned con?gurations may be selected with a single command.
The primary goal was to decrease the number of subroutine calls required
to transfer non-display listed geometry data to the GL. A secondary goal was to
improve the ef?ciency of the transfer; especially to allow direct memory access
(DMA) hardware to be used to effect the transfer. The additions match those of
the EXT vertex array extension, except that static array data are not supported
(because they complicated the interface, and were not being used), and the pre-
de?ned con?gurations are added (both to reduce subroutine count even further,
and to allow for ef?cient transfer of array data).
306C.2. POLYGONOFFSET 307
C.2 Polygon Offset
Depth values of fragments generated by the rasterization of a polygon may be
shifted toward or away from the origin, as an af?ne function of the window coor-
dinate depth slope of the polygon. Shifted depth values allow coplanar geometry,
especially facet outlines, to be rendered without depth buffer artifacts. They may
also be used by future shadow generation algorithms.
The additions match those of the EXT polygon offset extension, with two
exceptions. First, the offset is enabled separately forPOINT,LINE, andFILL ras-
terization modes, all sharing a single af?ne function de?nition. (Shifting the depth
values of the outline fragments, instead of the ?ll fragments, allows the contents of
the depth buffer to be maintained correctly.) Second, the offset bias is speci?ed in
units of depth buffer resolution, rather than in the [0,1] depth range.
C.3 Logical Operation
Fragments generated by RGBA rendering may be merged into the framebuffer us-
ing a logical operation, just as color index fragments are in GL version 1.0. Blend-
ing is disabled during such operation because it is rarely desired, because many sys-
tems could not support it, and to match the semantics of theEXT blend logic op
extension, on which this addition is loosely based.
C.4 Texture Image Formats
Stored texture arrays have a format, known as the internal format, rather than a
simple count of components. The internal format is represented as a single enumer-
ated value, indicating both the organization of the image data (LUMINANCE, RGB,
etc.) and the number of bits of storage for each image component. Clients can use
the internal format speci?cation to suggest the desired storage precision of texture
images. New base formats,ALPHA andINTENSITY, provide new texture environ-
ment operations. These additions match those of a subset of the EXT texture
extension.
C.5 Texture Replace Environment
A common use of texture mapping is to replace the color values of generated
fragments with texture color data. This could be speci?ed only indirectly in GL
version 1.0, which required that client speci?ed “white” geometry be modulated
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004C.6. TEXTUREPROXIES 308
by a texture. GL version 1.1 allows such replacement to be speci?ed explicitly,
possibly improving performance. These additions match those of a subset of the
EXT texture extension.
C.6 Texture Proxies
Texture proxies allow a GL implementation to advertise different maximum tex-
ture image sizes as a function of some other texture parameters, especially of the
internal image format. Clients may use the proxy query mechanism to tailor their
use of texture resources at run time. The proxy interface is designed to allow such
queries without adding new routines to the GL interface. These additions match
those of a subset of the EXT texture extension, except that implementations re-
turn allocation information consistent with support for complete mipmap arrays.
C.7 Copy Texture and Subtexture
Texture array data can be speci?ed from framebuffer memory, as well as from
client memory, and rectangular subregions of texture arrays can be rede?ned either
from client or framebuffer memory. These additions match those de?ned by the
EXT copy texture andEXT subtexture extensions.
C.8 Texture Objects
A set of texture arrays and their related texture state can be treated as a single ob-
ject. Such treatment allows for greater implementation ef?ciency when multiple
arrays are used. In conjunction with the subtexture capability, it also allows clients
to make gradual changes to existing texture arrays, rather than completely rede?n-
ing them. These additions match those of the EXT texture object extension,
with slight additions to the texture residency semantics.
C.9 Other Changes
1. Color indices may now be speci?ed as unsigned bytes.
2. Texture coordinates s, t, and r are divided by q during the rasterization of
points, pixel rectangles, and bitmaps. This division was documented only
for lines and polygons in the 1.0 version.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004C.10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 309
3. The line rasterization algorithm was changed so that vertical lines on pixel
borders rasterize correctly.
4. Separate pixel transfer discussions in chapter 3 and chapter 4 were combined
into a single discussion in chapter 3.
5. Texture alpha values are returned as 1.0 if there is no alpha channel in the
texture array. This behavior was unspeci?ed in the 1.0 version, and was
incorrectly documented in the reference manual.
6. Fog start and end values may now be negative.
7. Evaluated color values direct the evaluation of the lighting equation if Col-
orMaterial is enabled.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix D
Version 1.2
OpenGL version 1.2, released on March 16, 1998, is the second revision since the
original version 1.0. Version 1.2 is upward compatible with version 1.1, meaning
that any program that runs with a 1.1 GL implementation will also run unchanged
with a 1.2 GL implementation.
Several additions were made to the GL, especially to texture mapping capa-
bilities and the pixel processing pipeline. Following are brief descriptions of each
addition.
D.1 Three-Dimensional Texturing
Three-dimensional textures can be de?ned and used. In-memory formats for three-
dimensional images, and pixel storage modes to support them, are also de?ned.
The additions match those of theEXT texture3D extension.
One important application of three-dimensional textures is rendering volumes
of image data.
D.2 BGRA Pixel Formats
BGRA extends the list of host-memory color formats. Speci?cally, it provides a
component order matching ?le and framebuffer formats common on Windows plat-
forms. The additions match those of theEXT bgra extension.
311D.3. PACKEDPIXELFORMATS 312
D.3 Packed Pixel Formats
Packed pixels in host memory are represented entirely by one unsigned byte, one
unsigned short, or one unsigned integer. The ?elds with the packed pixel are not
proper machine types, but the pixel as a whole is. Thus the pixel storage modes
and their unpacking counterparts all work correctly with packed pixels.
The additions match those of the EXT packed pixels extension, with the
further addition of reversed component order packed formats.
D.4 Normal Rescaling
Normals may be rescaled by a constant factor derived from the model-view matrix.
Rescaling can operate faster than renormalization in many cases, while resulting in
the same unit normals.
The additions are based on theEXT rescale normal extension.
D.5 Separate Specular Color
Lighting calculations are modi?ed to produce a primary color consisting of emis-
sive, ambient and diffuse terms of the usual GL lighting equation, and a secondary
color consisting of the specular term. Only the primary color is modi?ed by the
texture environment; the secondary color is added to the result of texturing to pro-
duce a single post-texturing color. This allows highlights whose color is based on
the light source creating them, rather than surface properties.
The additions match those of the EXT separate specular color exten-
sion.
D.6 Texture Coordinate Edge Clamping
GL normally clamps such that the texture coordinates are limited to exactly the
range[0,1]. When a texture coordinate is clamped using this algorithm, the texture
sampling ?lter straddles the edge of the texture image, taking half its sample values
from within the texture image, and the other half from the texture border. It is
sometimes desirable to clamp a texture without requiring a border, and without
using the constant border color.
A new texture clamping algorithm, CLAMP TO EDGE, clamps texture coordi-
nates at all mipmap levels such that the texture ?lter never samples a border texel.
The color returned when clamping is derived only from texels at the edge of the
texture image.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004D.7. TEXTURELEVELOFDETAILCONTROL 313
The additions match those of theSGIS texture edge clamp extension.
D.7 Texture Level of Detail Control
Two constraints related to the texture level of detail parameter ? are added. One
constraint clamps ? to a speci?ed ?oating point range. The other limits the se-
lection of mipmap image arrays to a subset of the arrays that would otherwise be
considered.
Together these constraints allow a large texture to be loaded and used initially
at low resolution, and to have its resolution raised gradually as more resolution is
desired or available. Image array speci?cation is necessarily integral, rather than
continuous. By providing separate, continuous clamping of the ? parameter, it is
possible to avoid ”popping” artifacts when higher resolution images are provided.
The additions match those of theSGIS texture lod extension.
D.8 Vertex Array Draw Element Range
A new form of DrawElements that provides explicit information on the range of
vertices referred to by the index set is added. Implementations can take advantage
of this additional information to process vertex data without having to scan the
index data to determine which vertices are referenced.
The additions match those of theEXT draw range elements extension.
D.9 Imaging Subset
The remaining new features are primarily intended for advanced image processing
applications, and may not be present in all GL implementations. The are collec-
tively referred to as the imaging subset.
D.9.1 Color Tables
A new RGBA-format color lookup mechanism is de?ned in the pixel transfer pro-
cess, providing additional lookup capabilities beyond the existing lookup. The key
difference is that the new lookup tables are treated as one-dimensional images with
internal formats, like texture images and convolution ?lter images. Thus the new
tables can operate on a subset of the components of passing pixel groups. For ex-
ample, a table with internal formatALPHA modi?es only the A component of each
pixel group, leaving the R, G, and B components unmodi?ed.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004D.9. IMAGINGSUBSET 314
Three independent lookups may be performed: prior to convolution; after con-
volution and prior to color matrix transformation; after color matrix transformation
and prior to gathering pipeline statistics.
Methods to initialize the color lookup tables from the framebuffer, in addition
to the standard memory source mechanisms, are provided.
Portions of a color lookup table may be rede?ned without reinitializing the
entire table. The affected portions may be speci?ed either from host memory or
from the framebuffer.
The additions match those of the EXT color table and
EXT color subtable extensions.
D.9.2 Convolution
One- or two-dimensional convolution operations are executed following the ?rst
color table lookup in the pixel transfer process. The convolution kernels are them-
selves treated as one- and two-dimensional images, which can be loaded from ap-
plication memory or from the framebuffer.
The convolution framework is designed to accommodate three-dimensional
convolution, but that API is left for a future extension.
The additions match those of the EXT convolution and
HP convolution border modes extensions.
D.9.3 Color Matrix
A 4x4 matrix transformation and associated matrix stack are added to the pixel
transfer path. The matrix operates on RGBA pixel groups, using the equation
0
C =MC,
where
? ?
R
? ?
G
? ?
C =
? ?
B
A
and M is the 4? 4 matrix on the top of the color matrix stack. After the
matrix multiplication, each resulting color component is scaled and biased by a
programmed amount. Color matrix multiplication follows convolution.
The color matrix can be used to reassign and duplicate color components. It
can also be used to implement simple color space conversions.
The additions match those of theSGI color matrix extension.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004D.10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 315
D.9.4 Pixel Pipeline Statistics
Pixel operations that count occurences of speci?c color component values (his-
togram) and that track the minimum and maximum color component values (min-
max) are performed at the end of the pixel transfer pipeline. An optional mode
allows pixel data to be discarded after the histogram and/or minmax operations are
completed. Otherwise the pixel data continues on to the next operation unaffected.
The additions match those of theEXT histogram extension.
D.9.5 Constant Blend Color
A constant color that can be used to de?ne blend weighting factors may be de?ned.
A typical usage is blending two RGB images. Without the constant blend factor,
one image must have an alpha channel with each pixel set to the desired blend
factor.
The additions match those of theEXT blend color extension.
D.9.6 New Blending Equations
Blending equations other than the normal weighted sum of source and destination
components may be used.
Two of the new equations produce the minimum (or maximum) color com-
ponents of the source and destination colors. Taking the maximum is useful for
applications such as maximum projection in medical imaging.
The other two equations are similar to the default blending equation, but pro-
duce the difference of its left and right hand sides, rather than the sum. Image
differences are useful in many image processing applications.
The additions match those of the EXT blend minmax and
EXT blend subtract extensions.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix E
Version 1.2.1
OpenGL version 1.2.1, released on October 14, 1998, introduced ARB extensions
(see Appendix J). The only ARB extension de?ned in this version is multitexture,
allowing application of multiple textures to a fragment in one rendering pass. Mul-
titexture is based on theSGIS multitexture extension, simpli?ed by removing
the ability to route texture coordinate sets to arbitrary texture units.
A new corollary discussing display list and immediate mode invariance was
added to Appendix B on April 1, 1999.
319Appendix F
Version 1.3
OpenGL version 1.3, released on August 14, 2001, is the third revision since the
original version 1.0. Version 1.3 is upward compatible with earlier versions, mean-
ing that any program that runs with a 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0 GL implementation will also
run unchanged with a 1.3 GL implementation.
Several additions were made to the GL, especially texture mapping capabilities
previously de?ned by ARB extensions. Following are brief descriptions of each
addition.
F.1 Compressed Textures
Compressing texture images can reduce texture memory utilization and improve
performance when rendering textured primitives. The GL provides a framework
upon which extensions providing speci?c compressed image formats can be built,
and a set of generic compressed internal formats that allow applications to specify
that texture images should be stored in compressed form without needing to code
for speci?c compression formats (speci?c compressed formats, such as S3TC or
FXT1, are supported by extensions).
Texture compression was promoted from the
GL ARB texture compression extension.
F.2 Cube Map Textures
Cube map textures provide a new texture generation scheme for looking up textures
from a set of six two-dimensional images representing the faces of a cube. The
(str) texture coordinates are treated as a direction vector emanating from the center
of a cube. At texture generation time, the interpolated per-fragment (str) selects
320F.3. MULTISAMPLE 321
one cube face two-dimensional image based on the largest magnitude coordinate
(the major axis). A new (st) is calculated by dividing the two other coordinates
(the minor axes values) by the major axis value, and the new(st) is used to lookup
into the selected two-dimensional texture image face of the cube map.
Two new texture coordinate generation modes are provided for use in con-
junction with cube map texturing. The REFLECTION MAP mode generates tex-
ture coordinates(str) matching the vertex’s eye-space re?ection vector, useful for
environment mapping without the singularity inherent in SPHERE MAP mapping.
TheNORMAL MAP mode generates texture coordinates matching the vertex’s trans-
formed eye-space normal, useful for texture-based diffuse lighting models.
Cube mapping was promoted from theGL ARB texture cube map extension.
F.3 Multisample
Multisampling provides a antialiasing mechanism which samples all primitives
multiple times at each pixel. The color sample values are resolved to a single, dis-
playable color each time a pixel is updated, so antialiasing appears to be automatic
at the application level. Because each sample includes depth and stencil infor-
mation, the depth and stencil functions perform equivalently to the single-sample
mode.
When multisampling is supported, an additional buffer, called the multisample
buffer, is added to the framebuffer. Pixel sample values, including color, depth, and
stencil values, are stored in this buffer.
Multisampling is usually an expensive operation, so it is usually not supported
on all contexts. Applications must obtain a multisample-capable context using the
new interfaces provided by GLX 1.4 or by theWGL ARB multisample extension.
Multisampling was promoted from theGL ARB multisample extension; The
de?nition of the extension was changed slightly to support both multisampling and
supersampling implementations.
F.4 Multitexture
Multitexture adds support for multiple texture units. The capabilities of the mul-
tiple texture units are identical, except that evaluation and feedback are supported
only for texture unit 0. Each texture unit has its own state vector which includes
texture vertex array speci?cation, texture image and ?ltering parameters, and tex-
ture environment application.
The texture environments of the texture units are applied in a pipelined fashion
whereby the output of one texture environment is used as the input fragment color
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004F.5. TEXTUREADDENVIRONMENTMODE 322
for the next texture environment. Changes to texture client state and texture server
state are each routed through one of two selectors which control which instance of
texture state is affected.
Multitexture was promoted from theGL ARB multitexture extension.
F.5 Texture Add Environment Mode
The TEXTURE ENV MODE texture environment function ADD provides a texture
function to add incoming fragment and texture source colors.
Texture add mode was promoted from the GL ARB texture env add exten-
sion.
F.6 Texture Combine Environment Mode
The TEXTURE ENV MODE texture environment function COMBINE provides a wide
range of programmable combiner functions using the incoming fragment color,
texture source color, texture constant color, and the result of the previous texture
environment stage as possible parameters.
Combiner operations include passthrough, multiplication, addition and biased
addition, subtraction, and linear interpolation of speci?ed parameters. Different
combiner operations may be selected for RGB and A components, and the ?nal
result may be scaled by 1, 2, or 4.
Texture combine was promoted from theGL ARB texture env combine ex-
tension.
F.7 Texture Dot3 Environment Mode
The TEXTURE ENV MODE COMBINE operations also provide three-component dot
products of speci?ed parameters, with the resulting scalar value replicated into the
RGB or RGBA components of the output color. The dot product is performed
using pseudo-signed arithmetic to enable per-pixel lighting computations.
Texture DOT3 mode was promoted from theGL ARB texture env dot3 ex-
tension.
F.8 Texture Border Clamp
The texture wrap parameter CLAMP TO BORDER mode clamps texture coordinates
at all mipmap levels such that when the texture ?lter straddles an edge of the texture
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004F.9. TRANSPOSEMATRIX 323
image, the color returned is derived only from border texels. This behavior mirrors
the behavior of the texture edge clamp mode introduced by OpenGL 1.2.
Texture border clamp was promoted from the
GL ARB texture border clamp extension.
F.9 Transpose Matrix
New functions and tokens are added allowing application matrices stored in row
major order rather than column major order to be transferred to the implementa-
tion. This allows an application to use standard C-language 2-dimensional arrays
and have the array indices match the expected matrix row and column indexes.
These arrays are referred to as transpose matrices since they are the transpose of
the standard matrices passed to OpenGL.
Transpose matrix adds an interface for transfering data to and from the OpenGL
pipeline. It does not change any OpenGL processing or imply any changes in state
representation.
Transpose matrix was promoted from theGL ARB transpose matrix exten-
sion.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix G
Version 1.4
OpenGL version 1.4, released on July 24, 2002, is the fourth revision since the
original version 1.0. Version 1.4 is upward compatible with earlier versions, mean-
ing that any program that runs with a 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0 GL implementation will
also run unchanged with a 1.4 GL implementation.
In addition to numerous additions to the classical ?xed-function GL pipeline
in OpenGL 1.4, the OpenGL ARB also approved the ARB vertex program ex-
tension, which supports programmable vertex processing. Following are brief
descriptions of each addition to OpenGL 1.4; see Chapter J for a description of
ARB vertex program.
G.1 Automatic Mipmap Generation
Setting the texture parameterGENERATE MIPMAP toTRUE introduces a side effect
to any modi?cation of thelevel of a mipmap array, wherein all higher levels of
base
the mipmap pyramid are recomputed automatically by successive ?ltering of the
base level array.
Automatic mipmap generation was promoted from the
SGIS generate mipmap extension.
G.2 Blend Squaring
Blend squaring extends the set of supported source and destination blend functions
to permit squaring RGB and alpha values during blending. FunctionsSRC COLOR
and ONE MINUS SRC COLOR are added to the allowed source blending functions,
andDST COLOR andONE MINUS DST COLOR are added to the allowed destination
blending functions.
328G.3. CHANGESTOTHEIMAGINGSUBSET 329
Blend squaring was promoted from theGL NV blend square extension.
G.3 Changes to the Imaging Subset
The subset of blending features described by BlendEquation, BlendColor,
and the BlendFunc modes CONSTANT COLOR, ONE MINUS CONSTANT COLOR,
CONSTANT ALPHA, andONE MINUS CONSTANT ALPHA are now supported. These
feature were available only in the optional imaging subset in versions 1.2 and 1.3
of the GL.
G.4 Depth Textures and Shadows
Depth textures de?ne a new texture internal format,DEPTH, normally used to repre-
sent depth values. Applications include image-based shadow casting, displacement
mapping, and image-based rendering.
Image-based shadowing is enabled with a new texture application mode de-
?ned by the parameter TEXTURE COMPARE MODE. This mode enables comparing
texturer coordinates to depth texture values to generate a boolean result.
Depth textures and shadows were promoted from theGL ARB depth texture
andGL ARB shadow extensions.
G.5 Fog Coordinate
A new associated vertex and fragment datum, the fog coordinate may be used
in computing fog for a fragment, instead of using eye distance to the frag-
ment, by specifying the coordinate with the FogCoord commands and setting the
FOG COORDINATE SOURCE fog parameter. Fog coordinates are particularly useful
in computing more complex fog models.
Fog coordinate was promoted from theGL EXT fog coord extension.
G.6 Multiple Draw Arrays
Multiple primitives may be drawn in a single call using the MultiDrawArrays and
MultiDrawElements commants.
Multiple draw arrays was promoted from the GL EXT multi draw arrays
extension.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004G.7. POINTPARAMETERS 330
G.7 Point Parameters
Point parameters de?ned by the PointParameter commands support additional
geometric characteristics of points, allowing the size of a point to be affected by
linear or quadratic distance attenuation, and increasing control of the mapping from
point size to raster point area and point transparency. This effect may be used for
distance attenuation in rendering particles or light points.
Point parameters was promoted from theGL ARB point parameters exten-
sion.
G.8 Secondary Color
The secondary color may be varied even when lighting is disabled by specifying it
as a vertex parameter with the SecondaryColor commands.
Secondary color was promoted from the GL EXT secondary color exten-
sion.
G.9 Separate Blend Functions
Blending capability is extended with BlendFuncSeparate to allow independent
setting of the RGB and alpha blend functions for blend operations that require
source and destination blend factors.
Separate blend functions was promoted from the
GL EXT blend func separate extension.
G.10 Stencil Wrap
New stencil operationsINCR WRAP andDECR WRAP allow the stencil value to wrap
around the range of stencil values instead of saturating to the minimum or maxi-
mum values on decrement or increment. Stencil wrapping is needed for algorithms
that use the stencil buffer for per-fragment inside-outside primitive computations.
Stencil wrap was promoted from theGL EXT stencil wrap extension.
G.11 Texture Crossbar Environment Mode
Texture crossbar extends the texture combine environment mode COMBINE by al-
lowing use of the texture color from different texture units as sources to the texture
combine function.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004G.12. TEXTURELODBIAS 331
Texture environment crossbar was promoted from the
ARB texture env crossbar extension.
G.12 Texture LOD Bias
The texture ?lter control parameter TEXTURE LOD BIAS may be set to bias the
computed? parameter used in texturing for mipmap level of detail selection, pro-
viding a means to blur or sharpen textures. LOD bias may be used for depth of ?eld
and other special visual effects, as well as for some types of image processing.
Texture LOD bias was based on theEXT texture lod bias extension, with
the addition of a second per-texture object bias term.
G.13 Texture Mirrored Repeat
Texture mirrored repeat extends the set of texture wrap modes with the mode
MIRRORED REPEAT. This effectively de?nes a texture map twice as large as the
original texture image in which the additional half, for each mirrored texture co-
ordinate, is a mirror image of the original texture. Mirrored repeat can be used
seamless tiling of a surface.
Texture mirrored repeat was promoted from the
ARB texture mirrored repeat extension.
G.14 Window Raster Position
The raster position may be set directly to speci?ed window coordinates with the
WindowPos commands, bypassing the transformation applied to RasterPos. Win-
dow raster position is particularly useful for imaging and other 2D operations.
Window raster position was promoted from the GL ARB window pos exten-
sion.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix H
Version 1.5
OpenGL version 1.5, released on July 29, 2003, is the ?fth revision since the orig-
inal version 1.0. Version 1.5 is upward compatible with earlier versions, meaning
that any program that runs with a 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0 GL implementation will
also run unchanged with a 1.5 GL implementation.
In addition to additions to the classical ?xed-function GL pipeline in OpenGL
1.5, the OpenGL ARB also approved a related set of ARB extensions includ-
ing the OpenGL Shading Language speci?cation and the ARB shader objects,
ARB vertex shader, and ARB fragment shader extensions through which
high-level shading language programs can be loaded and used in place of the ?xed-
function pipeline.
Following are brief descriptions of each addition to OpenGL 1.5. The low-level
and high-level shading languages are important adjuncts to the OpenGL core. They
are described in more detail in appendix J, and their corresponding ARB extension
speci?cations are available online as described in that appendix.
H.1 Buffer Objects
Buffer objects allow various types of data (especially vertex array data) to be
cached in high-performance graphics memory on the server, thereby increasing
the rate of data transfers to the GL.
Buffer objects were promoted from the ARB vertex buffer object exten-
sion.
334H.2. OCCLUSIONQUERIES 335
H.2 Occlusion Queries
An occlusion query is a mechanism whereby an application can query the number
of pixels (or, more precisely, samples) drawn by a primitive or group of primitives.
The primary purpose of occlusion queries is to determine the visibility of an object.
Occlusion query was promoted from theARB occlusion query extension.
H.3 Shadow Functions
Texture comparison functions are generalized to support all eight binary functions
rather than justLEQUAL andGEQUAL.
Texture comparison functions were promoted from the EXT shadow funcs
extension.
H.4 Changed Tokens
To achieve consistency with the syntax guidelines for OpenGL function and token
names, new token names are introduced to be used in place of old, inconsistent
names. However, the old token names continue to be supported, for backwards
compatibility with code written for previous versions of OpenGL. The new names,
and the old names they replace, are shown in table H.1.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix I
Version 2.0
OpenGL version 2.0, released on September 7, 2004, is the sixth revision since the
original version 1.0. Despite incrementing the major version number (to indicate
support for high-level programmable shaders), version 2.0 is upward compatible
with earlier versions, meaning that any program that runs with a 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2,
1.1, or 1.0 GL implementation will also run unchanged with a 2.0 GL implemen-
tation.
Following are brief descriptions of each addition to OpenGL 2.0.
I.1 Programmable Shading
The OpenGL Shading Language, and the related APIs to create, manage, and use
programmable shaders written in the Shading Language, were promoted to core
features in OpenGL 2.0. The complete list of features related to programmable
shading includes:
I.1.1 Shader Objects
Shader objects provides mechanisms necessary to manage shader and program ob-
jects. Shader objects were promoted from theARB shader objects extension.
I.1.2 Shader Programs
Vertex and fragment shader programs may be written in the high-level OpenGL
Shading Language, replacing ?xed-functionality vertex and fragment process-
ing respectively. Vertex and fragment shader programs were promoted from the
ARB vertex shader andARB fragment shader extensions.
340I.2. MULTIPLERENDERTARGETS 341
I.1.3 OpenGL Shading Language
The OpenGL Shading Language is a high-level, C-like language used to program
the vertex and fragment pipelines. The Shading Language Specification de?nes
the language proper, while OpenGL API features control how vertex and fragment
programs interact with the ?xed-function OpenGL pipeline and how applications
manage those programs.
OpenGL 2.0 implementations must support at least revision 1.10
of the OpenGL Shading Language. Implementations may query the
SHADING LANGUAGE VERSION string to determine the exact version of the
language supported. The OpenGL Shading Language was promoted from the
ARB shading language 100 extension (the shading language itself is speci?ed
in a companion document; due to the way it’s written, that document did not
need to be changed as a consequence of promoting programmable shading to the
OpenGL core).
I.1.4 Changes To Shader APIs
Small changes to the APIs for managing shader and program objects were made
in the process of promoting the shader extensions to the OpenGL 2.0 core. These
changes do not affect the functionality of the shader APIs, but include use of the
existinguint core GL type rather than the newhandleARB type introduced by
the extensions, and changes in some function names, for example mapping the ex-
tension function CreateShaderObjectARB into the core function CreateShader.
I.2 Multiple Render Targets
Programmable shaders may write different colors to multiple output color
buffers in a single pass. Multiple render targets was promoted from the
ARB draw buffers extension.
I.3 Non-Power-Of-Two Textures
The restriction of textures to power-of-two dimensions has been relaxed for
all texture targets, so that non-power-of-two textures may be speci?ed with-
out generating errors. Non-power-of-two textures was promoted from the
ARB texture non power of two extension.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004I.4. POINTSPRITES 342
I.4 Point Sprites
Point sprites replace point texture coordinates with texture coordinates interpolated
across the point. This allows drawing points as customized textures, useful for
particle systems.
Point sprites were promoted from theARB point sprite extension, with the
further addition of the POINT SPRITE COORD ORIGIN parameter controlling the
direction in which thet texture coordinate increases.
I.5 Separate Stencil
Separate stencil functionality may be de?ned for the front and back faces of primi-
tives, improving performance of shadow volume and Constructive Solid Geometry
rendering algorithms.
Separate stencil was based on the the API of the ATI separate stencil
extension, with additional state de?ned by the similar EXT stencil two side
extension.
I.6 Other Changes
Several minor revisions and corrections to the OpenGL 1.5 speci?cation were
made:
• In section 2.7, SecondaryColor3 was changed to set A to 1.0 (previously
0.0), so the initial GL state can be restored.
• In section 2.13, transformation was added to the list of steps not performed
by WindowPos.
• Section 3.8.1 was clari?ed to mandate that selection of texture internal for-
mat must allocate a non-zero number of bits for all components named by
the internal format, and zero bits for all other components.
• Tables 3.22 and 3.23 were generalized to multiple textures by replacingC
f
withC .
p
• In section 6.1.9, GetHistogram was clari?ed to note that the Final Conver-
sion pixel storage mode is not applied when storing histogram counts.
• TheFOG COORD ARRAY BUFFER BINDING enumerant alias was added to ta-
ble H.1.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004I.7. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 343
After the initial version of the OpenGL 2.0 was released, several more minor
corrections were made in the speci?cation revision approved on October 22, 2004:
• Corrected name of the fog source from FOG COORD SRC to FOG COORD in
section 2.13.
• Corrected last parameter type in the declaration of the UniformMatrix*
commands toconst float *value, in section 2.15.3.
• Changed the end of the second paragraph of the Conversion to Fragments
subsection of section 3.6.4, to more clearly describe the set of generated
fragments.
• Changed from the olderFOG COORDINATE to the newerFOG COORD notation
in section 3.10.
• AddedPOINT SPRITE COORD ORIGIN state to table 6.13.
• Changed the description of MAX TEXTURE UNITS in table 6.34 to re?ect its
legacy status (referring to the number of ?xed-function texture units), and
moved it into table 6.35.
• Removed duplicated table entries for MAX TEXTURE IMAGE UNITS and
MAX TEXTURE COORDS from table 6.35.
• Added Victor Vedovato to the OpenGL 2.0 Acknowledgements section.
• Miscellaneous typographical corrections.

Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004Appendix J
ARB Extensions
OpenGL extensions that have been approved by the OpenGL Architectural Review
Board (ARB) are described in this chapter. These extensions are not required to be
supported by a conformant OpenGL implementation, but are expected to be widely
available; they de?ne functionality that is likely to move into the required feature
set in a future revision of the speci?cation.
In order not to compromise the readability of the core speci?cation, ARB ex-
tensions are not integrated into the core language; instead, they are made available
online in the OpenGL Extension Registry (as are a much larger number of vendor-
speci?c extensions, as well as extensions to GLX and WGL). Extensions are doc-
umented as changes to the Specification. The Registry is available on the World
Wide Web at URL
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/
Brief descriptions of ARB extensions are provided below.
J.1 Naming Conventions
To distinguish ARB extensions from core OpenGL features and from vendor-
speci?c extensions, the following naming conventions are used:
• A unique name string of the form "GL ARB name" is associated with each
extension. If the extension is supported by an implementation, this string
will be present in theEXTENSIONS string described in section 6.1.11.
• All functions de?ned by the extension will have names of the form Func-
tionARB
345J.2. PROMOTINGEXTENSIONSTOCOREFEATURES 346
• All enumerants de?ned by the extension will have names of the form
NAME ARB.
J.2 Promoting Extensions to Core Features
ARB extensions can be promoted to required core features in later revisions of
OpenGL. When this occurs, the extension speci?cations are merged into the core
speci?cation. Functions and enumerants that are part of such promoted extensions
will have the ARB af?x removed.
GL implementations of such later revisions should continue to export the name
strings of promoted extensions in theEXTENSIONS string, and continue to support
the ARB-af?xed versions of functions and enumerants as a transition aid.
For descriptions of extensions promoted to core features in OpenGL 1.3 and
beyond, see appendices F, G, H, and I respectively.
J.3 Multitexture
The name string for multitexture isGL ARB multitexture. It was promoted to a
core feature in OpenGL 1.3.

tex units. Each unit has its own transform matrix and an associated current weight.
Vertices are transformed by all the enabled units, scaled by their respective weights,
and summed to create the eye-space vertex. Normals are similarly transformed by
the inverse transpose of the model-view matrices.
The name string for vertex blend isGL ARB vertex blend.
J.12 Matrix Palette
Matrix palette extends vertex blending to include a palette of model-view matrices.
Each vertex may be transformed by a different set of matrices chosen from the
palette.

The name string for shadow isGL ARB shadow. It was promoted to a core feature
in OpenGL 1.4.
J.19 Shadow Ambient
Shadow ambient extends the basic image-based shadow functionality by allowing
a texture value speci?ed by theTEXTURE COMPARE FAIL VALUE ARB texture pa-
rameter to be returned when the texture comparison fails. This may be used for
ambient lighting of shadowed fragments and other advanced lighting effects.
The name string for shadow ambient isGL ARB shadow ambient.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004J.20. WINDOWRASTERPOSITION 349
J.20 Window Raster Position
The name string for window raster position is GL ARB window pos. It was pro-
moted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.4.
J.21 Low-Level Vertex Programming
Application-de?ned vertex programs may be speci?ed in a new low-level program-
ming language, replacing the standard ?xed-function vertex transformation, light-
ing, and texture coordinate generation pipeline. Vertex programs enable many new
effects and are an important ?rst step towards future graphics pipelines that will be
fully programmable in an unrestricted, high-level shading language.
The name string for low-level vertex programming isARB vertex program.
J.22 Low-Level Fragment Programming
Application-de?ned fragment programs may be speci?ed in the same low-level
language as ARB vertex program, replacing the standard ?xed-function vertex
texturing, fog, and color sum operations.
The name string for low-level fragment programming is
ARB fragment program.
J.23 Buffer Objects
The name string for buffer objects is ARB vertex buffer object. It was pro-
moted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.5.
J.24 Occlusion Queries
The name string for occlusion queries isARB occlusion query. It was promoted
to a core feature in OpenGL 1.5.
J.25 Shader Objects
The name string for shader objects isARB shader objects. It was promoted to
a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004J.26. HIGH-LEVELVERTEXPROGRAMMING 350
J.26 High-Level Vertex Programming
The name string for high-level vertex programming is ARB vertex shader. It
was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
J.27 High-Level Fragment Programming
The name string for high-level fragment programming isARB fragment shader.
It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
J.28 OpenGL Shading Language
The name string for the OpenGL Shading Language is
ARB shading language 100. The presence of this extension string indi-
cates that programs written in version 1 of the Shading Language are accepted by
OpenGL.
It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
J.29 Non-Power-Of-Two Textures
The name string for non-power-of-two tex-
tures is ARB texture non power of two. It was promoted to a core feature
in OpenGL 2.0.
J.30 Point Sprites
The name string for point sprites is ARB point sprite. It was promoted to a
core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
J.31 Fragment Program Shadow
Fragment program shadow extends low-level fragment programs de?ned with
ARB fragment program to add shadow 1D, 2D, and 3D texture targets, and re-
move the interaction the interaction withARB shadow.
The name string for fragment program shadow is
ARB fragment program shadow.
Version 2.0 - October 22, 2004J.32. MULTIPLERENDERTARGETS 351
J.32 Multiple Render Targets
The name string for multiple render targets is ARB draw buffers. It was pro-
moted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.
J.33 Rectangular Textures
Rectangular textures de?ne a new texture target TEXTURE RECTANGLE ARB that
supports 2D textures without requiring power-of-two dimensions. Rectangular
textures are useful for storing video images that do not have power-of-two sized
(POTS). Resampling artifacts are avoided and less texture memory may be re-
quired. They are are also useful for shadow maps and window-space texturing.
These textures are accessed by dimension-dependent (aka non-normalized) texture
coordinates.
Rectangular textures are a restricted version of non-power-of-two textures. The
differences are that rectangular textures are supported only for 2D; they require a
new texture target; and the new target uses non-normalizes texture coordinates
The name string for texture rectangles isARB texture rectangle.
